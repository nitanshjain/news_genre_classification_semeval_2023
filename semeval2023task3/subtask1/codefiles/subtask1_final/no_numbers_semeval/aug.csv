74,hey remember five minute ago when pope francis shout at reporter in chile that there be no evidence support complaint against his good friend bishop juan barros and just for good measure he accuse the people accuse he victim of sexual abuse by barros mentor the convict sex predator karadima of commit calumny and remember when cardinal malley tell the pope off in public over the pain these accusation have cause the victim of sexual abuse and then remember how the pope have apologise except not really because the accusation be after i still lie and that there still no evidence against barros the press secular as well as catholic be full this week of the story that the pope do indeed see evidence of barros complicity in karadima sexual abuse not only that barro have help to cover it up but that he have be present and direct witness at the time and therefore passive participant nicole winfield and the associated press drop the bomb that the information come directly from the victim whom francis have dismiss and refuse to meet with on his trip and deliver through his own commission on sexual abuse pope francis receive victim letter in that graphically detail how priest sexually abuse he and how other chilean clergy ignore it contradict the pope recent insistence that no victim have come forward to denounce the cover up the letter author and member of francis own sex abuse commission have tell the associated press the fact that francis receive the eight page letter obtain by the ap challenge his insistence that he have zero tolerance for sex abuse and cover up it also call into question his state empathy with abuse survivor compound the most serious crisis of his five year papacy now it appear that francis have also overrule warning from the congregation for the doctrine of that faith that barro should not be make bishop the italian catholic daily la nuova bussola quotidiana report that not only do the pope see letter from victim but that the cdf under muller have already conduct an preliminary investigation into barro and the other bishop close to karadima which have lead to the decision to relieve they of their duty but with letter sign by the pope in january and send to the chilean bishop the request for exemption be block and shortly thereafter barro be promote to osorno the article point out that while karadima be convict by vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victim it be the same testimony of the same victim witness that francis now dismiss in the accusation against barro the accusation that stand against karadima come from the same source with those against barro who the victim say be in the room watch at the time while the specific be still not know reader may be remind by this of peculiar incident about year later in which pope francis summarily order the dismissal of three priest of the cdf whose remit be investigation of cleric accuse of sexual abuse the website one peter five report via marco tosatti that the pope order their removal without offer any explanation to then cardinal prefect gerhard muller when after several attempt and three month later muller be able to get an audience with the pope to ask the reason he receive the response be the pope do not need to give reason for any of my decision have decide that they have to leave and they have to leave marco tosatti report the cdf incident but it follow an odd story of meeting of curial official to discuss certain bishop appointment without name name or frustratingly give date tosatti relate it be some time ago to make bishop not in italy the nuncio have prepare the triad the terna or list of three candidate cardinal head of the dicastery perhaps the same holder of the congregation for bishop during the ordinary assembly take the floor say the first candidate indicate be excellent the second be good but would like to warn of the third whom know well since he be seminarian and who present problem both on the level of doctrine and morality he respond little to the necessary criterion but the third be friend of someone and another cardinal of the circle currently in power have fling himself at his colleague accuse he of impropriety the meeting end without further decision whatever the detail of these strange incident what be clear in chile be that no amount of eyewitness testimony be go to make the slight difference bergoglio want barro as bishop and that be that even while apologise the pope have double down when question about it by journalist say you in all good will tell that there be victim but haven see any because they haven come forward in the case of barro it be observe it be study there no evidence the good thing to do if someone believe it the case be to come forward quickly with evidence the ap report however say exactly the opposite that member of his own now defunct abuse commission have approach cardinal malley the pope top abuse advisor with the letter to deliver to the pope marie collins the irish abuse survivor and commission member who resign cite the vatican refusal to take meaningful action tell ap when we give he malley the letter for the pope he assure we he would give it to the pope and speak of the concern and at later date he assure we that that have be do juan carlos cruz the karadima victim whose membership on the commission the vatican have block tell ap cardinal malley call after the pope visit here in philadelphia and he tell among other thing that he have give the letter to the pope in his hand on the face of it there be only few logical possibility here in fact unless cardinal malley who have as of this writing remain silent come forward and say that he didn hand the letter over pope there be really only one that the pope lie and this be what be now be say quite openly by vast array of voice secular and catholic left and right as winfield write the revelation could be costly for francis whose track record on the abuse crisis be already shaky after botched italian abuse case he intervene in become public more recently he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year vatican analyst now openly question whether he get it and some of his own adviser privately acknowledge that maybe he doesn no evidence lie big lie often and when catch keep lie one of the many thing these secular reporter seem not to be pay attention to be that no evidence be in fact well rehearse stock response for bergoglio he say almost exactly the same in when confront about another predatory homosexual he be shelter the hoopla surround the who be to judge comment tend to obscure the context of the comment it be make in response to question by journalist about monsignore battista ricca prelate whose promiscuous homosexuality be so well know it be cover by the telegraph as early as july ilze scamparini ask the pope about ricca say what you intend to do about this how be you confront this issue and how do your holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby what reply do bergoglio give his standard one no evidence about monsignor ricca do what canon law call for that be preliminary investigation and from this investigation there be nothing of what have be allege we do not find anything of that this be the response he add in this case conduct the preliminary investigation and we didn find anything but ricca activity for which the pope claim there be no evidence be notorious they include be catch in flagrante in an elevator with teenaged male prostitute and his sexual relationship with captain in the swiss army so flagrant be ricca behaviour that it take intervention by uruguay nuncio to have he remove it be report in and by espresso who say the information be confirm by numerous bishop priest religious and laity in uruguay in fact the evidence show that ricca be completely in line with bergoglio normal procedure as marcantonio colonna write in the dictator pope in fact his patronage of monsignor ricca fit the pattern which be well establish when he be archbishop of bueno aire whereby he surround himself with morally weak people so as to have they under his thumb it be at this early no evidence comment on the plane home from rio that some of those pay attention start to understand that bergoglio policy be in line with that of certain leader of the past who recommend that if politician be go to lie he should lie big and lie brazenly and in case anyone be wonder what will happen next the same advice say to keep on lie after you re catch the pattern of silence and when press flat out denial have be bergoglio policy since long before he come on the international scene he have long record in argentina of shaving close to scandal and vociferously deny involvement and rely heavily on the broad good will of catholic towards bishop to pull it off perhaps his big error with barro be fail to understand just how little of that capital of trust there be leave in the catholic world as whole indeed on the subject of priest sexually abuse young people it could only be measure in the negative number argentine victim who try to meet with pope francis though the website bishop accountability be blatantly anti clerical their data be unassailable since most of it come from information that be already public on their argentina page be long list of accusation that bergoglio francis simply isn interested in hear from victim in pope francis year as bishop and archbishop of bueno air the wall street journal report include the year when he head the argentine bishop conference he decline to meet with victim of sexual abuse all of they try to contact the cardinal archbishop in or later the same period when pope benedict and other bishop be strive to meet with victim and demonstrate an interest in the problem the site say that in addition to bergoglio failure to respond to victim the public record contain no evidence that he release any information about abuser in fact he go so far as to flatly deny there have be any instance of abuse in his archdiocese week after his election to the papacy he be quote by his close friend rabbi abraham skorka in my diocese it never happen to but bishop call once by phone to ask what to do in situation like this francis add that he agree with the zero tolerance attitude of the irish episcopate and admired pope benedict reform most of which he be later to quietly reverse it be at exactly this time however that victim from argentina be attempt to get the new pope attention one know to the press only as gabriel want to talk to francis about the sexual abuse he suffer at the hand of julio cesar grassi accuse of molest at least five boy who have be avoid the sentence of the justice of moron and the court of cassation so far judge and prosecutor at all instance find he guilty in case anyone think the grassi gabriel case be not serious enough for the pope attention bishop accountability summarise year after gabriel have file criminal charge but before the start of grassi trial three man ransack the survivor apartment and beat he these man threaten to kill he if he do not retract his testimony and quit the case ten year after gabriel file criminal charge in may with grassi still free despite his conviction in gabriel and his attorney juan pablo gallego bring two page letter address to pope francis to the office of the papal nuncio in bueno air an employee refuse to accept the letter after learn of its topic and threaten to call security if gabriel and gallego do not leave the premise the group surmise that it be bergoglio direct intervention with judge in the case that prevent conviction against grassi for so long and delay his sentencing through multiple appeal in then archbishop bergoglio complain of media campaign and claim that the grassi case be different from other accusation during his criminal trial grassi say bergoglio never let go of his hand in grassi be convict of two count of aggravate sexual assault and corruption in the case of gabriel who be age at the time of the abuse but the appeal drag on until he be finally send to prison in september several more similar case all of whom be rebuff in their attempt to meet with bergoglio be detail here for the strong of stomach virtuoso performance liar look back and carefully examine his record jorge bergoglio mastery of use the weakness of morally compromise man be become evident it be arguable that even the member of the so call san gallen mafia who apparently conspire to put he on peter throne be use by he but he be also master of judge an audience and tell they what they expect to hear key skill for all grifter and confidence trickster look carefully at the infamous who be to judge comment this be clear early on the first part of that interview be blatant and enormous lie and it be from there that the pope move on to his apology for homosexuality in general recall that this be the very first airplane interview on the trip back to rome from world youth day in rio matter of week after his election at the time the papal apologist spring instantly into action and we hear all about how the pope be talk strictly within the boundary of catholic doctrine but perhaps in hindsight we be ready to examine the full implication of his little speech one that be clearly well rehearse don forget no question be ask in papal interview without be thoroughly vet ahead of time journalist must submit their question well in advance this be the pope lay out his policy regard homosexuality policy for which he be duly reward by be laud on the cover of the homosexualist lobby we trade magazine read his full answer carefully see that many time in the church over and above this case but include this case people search for sin from youth for example and then publish they they be not crime right crime be something different the abuse of minor be crime no sin but if person whether it be lay person priest or religious sister commit sin and then convert the lord forgive and when the lord forgive the lord forget and this be very important for our life when we confess our sin and we truly say have sin in this the lord forget and so we have no right not to forget because otherwise we would run the risk of the lord not forget our sin that be danger this be important theology of sin many time think of saint peter he commit one of the bad sin that be he deny christ and even with this sin they make he pope we have to think great deal about that but return to your question more concretely in this case conduct the preliminary investigation and we didn find anything this be the first question then you speak about the gay lobby so much be write about the gay lobby still haven find anyone with an identity card in the vatican with gay on it they say there be some there believe that when you be deal with such person you must distinguish between the fact of person be gay and the fact of someone form lobby because not all lobby be good this one be not good if someone be gay and be search for the lord and have good will then who be to judge he the catechism of the catholic church explain this in beautiful way say wait moment how do it say it it say no one should marginalize these people for this they must be integrate into society the problem be not have this tendency no we must be brother and sister to one another and there be this one and there be that one the problem be in make lobby of this tendency lobby of miser lobby of politician lobby of mason so many lobby for this be the great problem thank you so much for ask this question many thank one of the pope favourite rhetorical technique be combination of beg the question and conspiracy he start by assume without any effort at defence or explanation point that concede the whole issue this be the first time pope have ever use the political term gay not homosexual not same sex attract but gay meaning that he start by adopt the entirety of the homosexualist movement linguistic manipulation language count in politic and pope use that term mean he be by implication start the discussion and his pontificate by align himself with the basic tenet of movement that be violently opposed to catholic moral teaching and in direct opposition to his immediate and still live predecessor in this case too he be address plane load of journalist who be either secular themselves or for the most part be the kind of catholic who believe it be fine to disagree with catholic teaching on sexuality there be very few conservative catholic in the vatican journalist pool this mean that his use of this language be conspiratorial wink and nod to his immediate audience sly message to say people talk all the time about gay lobby but you and both know this be mostly nonsense propaganda from those people those conservative we cool and hip people don hate gay do we this astonishing departure follow an implied but very clear assertion that ricca have repent and give up his activity an assertion that have absolutely no evidence to back it up we be simply ask to take the pope word for it but give that it follow his astoundingly brazen lie that there be no evidence for ricca homosexual activity in the first place we can take the assurance for what it seem to be worth next after another little inside nudge nudge wink wink joke about the gay lobby implying but of course never outright say that the whole thing be hysterical nonsense we hear direct contradiction to catholic teaching from no less source than his predecessor pope benedict ratzinger the problem be not have this tendency well actually your holiness yes it be particularly in the case of priest the tendency be call in the same catechism you quote intrinsically disorder and ratzinger be very clear that this tendency be sign of serious emotional dysfunction that must preclude man from be ordain squander the capital of trust few month ago in piece for the remnant talk about why the church and nearly all human society regard lie as sin mistake many make about lie be to understand it only in term of morality but thomas make the point that it be first matter of metaphysic lie be an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality thomistic theology teach that it be by lie that we become most like the devil and most unlike god because we be try to change the nature of reality to suit our own purpose habitual lie in effect change you into different kind of be one that be by nature an opponent of truth order against truth this of course mean that person whose orientation as we might say be towards falsehood even when he be at any give moment say something true be still service his lie he tell the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality it be not by violence but by lie and manipulation by issue half truth and pretend to be the kind of man he be not that shakespeare character iago earn the title of most evil character in english literature human being be naturally order towards the truth and we have to work at assume lie this be why confidence trickster can be successful why lie work for get what you want people don see it come the first natural assumption be trust at least at the basic level of expect truth most of the time we therefore instinctively see lie as betrayal of trust consider how much trust the catholic faithful have in the papacy until about how much un earn trust francis start with just by be elect this pontificate should be remember as one of the great confidence scam in history believe catholic have watch aghast as this pope have habitually trample on every aspect of catholic teaching sandro magister recently publish piece on his website that list in dizzying detail the many time in only the last few month that pope francis have falsify with obvious intention the word of christ in scripture and the teaching of the church of course this would be of little interest to secular journalist who have pay no mind to his habit of rewrite catholicism but the sex abuse crisis be something secular journalist be very interested in fact bergoglio seem not to have understand it be now irrefutable that pope bergoglio be habitual liar that in fact truth like reality seem to mean nothing to he except as tool sociologist talk about the concept of the high trust society one in which citizen believe what they be tell by the elite and trust they to govern and protect they adequately they warn that the general loss of trust in institution lead to general state of chaos in which law on the book matter little as citizen turn to their last resort of protect themselves and their own family this be the way society disintegrate it have be say many time that the sex abuse crisis have create massive loss of trust in prelate among the catholic faithful and this be true with professional confidence trickster on the papal throne blatantly use lie and manipulation to maintain power and ram through an agenda at radical variance with catholic doctrine how long before that predictable disintegration occur be we see it already be we see it in the declaration of this or that episcopate on amoris laetitia and communion for divorced and civilly remarry catholic with cardinal marx and other promote blessing for same sex union be we go to be see an escalation of it have see veritable chorus of catholic on social medium declare that if paul vi be canonise their loss of faith in the church as an institution will be complete be tell from contact inside the vatican that after the trip to chile bergoglio support have completely dry up he have no more resource of trust even among the people he have choose to surround himself with and after the report of cardinal sandri go toe to toe with he in shout match it seem that perhaps even his legendary vicious temper tantrum be fail to have the desire effect of terrorise his subordinate into submission marie collin by no stretch even conservative catholic echo this concern say the barros affair have definitely undermine credibility trust and hope in francis all can say be that people who have lot of hope in this particular pope and be talk about just ordinary catholic that know in my own parish would find it very difficult now and can not understand and can not believe that this particular pope have say the thing he have say in the last few week she tell the national catholic reporter it may seem like moment to enjoy see the apparently unbreachable shell of papal teflon finally crack but in reality this situation be potentially very harmful for soul in the long run there be multitude of problem this pontificate have create or make bad that we will be deal with for long time after bergoglio be go but perhaps one of the big one will be the destruction of trust already fracture since the collapse of all catholic institution after vatican ii and the horror of the sex abuse crisis how much will there be to repair of the once steadfast trust catholic instinctively have in the church after this note not one victim have come forward in chile show the proof this be slander and calumny be that clear the book the dictator pope relate that regular meeting between the pope and dicastery head have be abolish and even high rank curia prefect be often unable to see the pope whose appointment be now completely control by the secretariat of state it be certainly clear that no one see the pope unless cardinal parolin approve which may be the reason cardinal zen in his effort to warn francis of the danger of vatican deal with the communist chinese government have to wait in the rain at wednesday general audience this be common in italian journalism that have somewhat different standard from that of the anglo world and drive the rest of we spare italians care about get general picture of what go on where anglo saxon be consider weirdly obsess with trivial detail though she never blame the pope marie collins complain that vatican officialdom have simply not implement the commission recommendation the time limit of the commission member be allow to lapse without renewal and though it be not dissolve formally the commission have cease to function with no word of any plan to revive it probably reference to the inzoli case in which francis overturn previous sentence of vatican tribunal after the priest now laicised approach some of the pope close advisor for help include cardinal coccopalmerio not that anyone in rome be try very hard sandro magister report after the who be to judge comment before the appointment francis have be show as be customary the personal file on ricca in which he have not find anything unseemly he have also hear from various personality of the curia and none of they have raise objectionspecial report papal cover up allege pope accuse in international sex abuse case,1

in the swiss army so flagrant be ricca behaviour that it take intervention by uruguay nuncio to have he remove it be report in and by espresso who say the information be confirm by numerous bishop priest religious and laity in uruguay in fact the evidence show that ricca be completely in line with bergoglio normal procedure as marcantonio colonna write in the dictator pope in fact his patronage of monsignor ricca fit the pattern which be well establish when he be archbishop of bueno aire whereby he surround himself with morally weak people so as to have they under his thumb it be at this early no evidence comment on the plane home from rio that some of those pay attention start to understand that bergoglio policy be in line with that of certain leader of the past who recommend that if politician be go to lie he should lie big and lie brazenly and in case anyone be wonder what will happen next the same advice say to keep on lie after you re catch the pattern of silence and when press flat out denial have be bergoglio policy since long before he come on the international scene he have long record in argentina of shaving close to scandal and vociferously deny involvement and rely heavily on the broad good will of catholic towards bishop to pull it off perhaps his big error with barro be fail to understand just how little of that capital of trust there be leave in the catholic world as whole indeed on the subject of priest sexually abuse young people it could only be measure in the negative number argentine victim who try to meet with pope francis though the website bishop accountability be blatantly anti clerical their data be unassailable since most of it come from information that be already public on their argentina page be long list of accusation that bergoglio francis simply isn interested in hear from victim in pope francis year as bishop and archbishop of bueno air the wall street journal report include the year when he head the argentine bishop conference he decline to meet with victim of sexual abuse all of they try to contact the cardinal archbishop in or later the same period when pope benedict and other bishop be strive to meet with victim and demonstrate an interest in the problem the site say that in addition to bergoglio failure to respond to victim the public record contain no evidence that he release any information about abuser in fact he go so far as to flatly deny there have be any instance of abuse in his archdiocese week after his election to the papacy he be quote by his close friend rabbi abraham skorka in my diocese it never happen to but bishop call once by phone to ask what to do in situation like this francis add that he agree with the zero tolerance attitude of the irish episcopate and admired pope benedict reform most of which he be later to quietly reverse it be at exactly this time however that victim from argentina be attempt to get the new pope attention one know to the press only as gabriel want to talk to francis about the sexual abuse he suffer at the hand of julio cesar grassi accuse of molest at least five boy who have be avoid the sentence of the justice of moron and the court of cassation so far judge and prosecutor at all instance find he guilty in case anyone think the grassi gabriel case be not serious enough for the pope attention bishop accountability summarise year after gabriel have file criminal charge but before the start of grassi trial three man ransack the survivor apartment and beat he these man threaten to kill he if he do not retract his testimony and quit the case ten year after gabriel file criminal charge in may with grassi still free despite his conviction in gabriel and his attorney juan pablo gallego bring two page letter address to pope francis to the office of the papal nuncio in bueno air an employee refuse to accept the letter after learn of its topic and threaten to call security if gabriel and gallego do not leave the premise the group surmise that it be bergoglio direct intervention with judge in the case that prevent conviction against grassi for so long and delay his sentencing through multiple appeal in then archbishop bergoglio complain of media campaign and claim that the grassi case be different from other accusation during his criminal trial grassi say bergoglio never let go of his hand in grassi be convict of two count of aggravate sexual assault and corruption in the case of gabriel who be age at the time of the abuse but the appeal drag on until he be finally send to prison in september several more similar case all of whom be rebuff in their attempt to meet with bergoglio be detail here for the strong of stomach virtuoso performance liar look back and carefully examine his record jorge bergoglio mastery of use the weakness of morally compromise man be become evident it be arguable that even the member of the so call san gallen mafia who apparently conspire to put he on peter throne be use by he but he be also master of judge an audience and tell they what they expect to hear key skill for all grifter and confidence trickster look carefully at the infamous who be to judge comment this be clear early on the first part of that interview be blatant and enormous lie and it be from there that the pope move on to his apology for homosexuality in general recall that this be the very first airplane interview on the trip back to rome from world youth day in rio matter of week after his election at the time the papal apologist spring instantly into action and we hear all about how the pope be talk strictly within the boundary of catholic doctrine but perhaps in hindsight we be ready to examine the full implication of his little speech one that be clearly well rehearse don forget no question be ask in papal interview without be thoroughly vet ahead of time journalist must submit their question well in advance this be the pope lay out his policy regard homosexuality policy for which he be duly reward by be laud on the cover of the homosexualist lobby we trade magazine read his full answer carefully see that many time in the church over and above this case but include this case people search for sin from youth for example and then publish they they be not crime right crime be something different the abuse of minor be crime no sin but if person whether it be lay person priest or religious sister commit sin and then convert the lord forgive and when the lord forgive the lord forget and this be very important for our life when we confess our sin and we truly say have sin in this the lord forget and so we have no right not to forget because otherwise we would run the risk of the lord not forget our sin that be danger this be important theology of sin many time think of saint peter he commit one of the bad sin that be he deny christ and even with this sin they make he pope we have to think great deal about that but return to your question more concretely in this case conduct the preliminary investigation and we didn find anything this be the first question then you speak about the gay lobby so much be write about the gay lobby still haven find anyone with an identity card in the vatican with gay on it they say there be some there believe that when you be deal with such person you must distinguish between the fact of person be gay and the fact of someone form lobby because not all lobby be good this one be not good if someone be gay and be search for the lord and have good will then who be to judge he the catechism of the catholic church explain this in beautiful way say wait moment how do it say it it say no one should marginalize these people for this they must be integrate into society the problem be not have this tendency no we must be brother and sister to one another and there be this one and there be that one the problem be in make lobby of this tendency lobby of miser lobby of politician lobby of mason so many lobby for this be the great problem thank you so much for ask this question many thank one of the pope favourite rhetorical technique be combination of beg the question and conspiracy he start by assume without any effort at defence or explanation point that concede the whole issue this be the first time pope have ever use the political term gay not homosexual not same sex attract but gay meaning that he start by adopt the entirety of the homosexualist movement linguistic manipulation language count in politic and pope use that term mean he be by implication start the discussion and his pontificate by align himself with the basic tenet of movement that be violently opposed to catholic moral teaching and in direct opposition to his immediate and still live predecessor in this case too he be address plane load of journalist who be either secular themselves or for the most part be the kind of catholic who believe it be fine to disagree with catholic teaching on sexuality there be very few conservative catholic in the vatican journalist pool this mean that his use of this language be conspiratorial wink and nod to his immediate audience sly message to say people talk all the time about gay lobby but you and both know this be mostly nonsense propaganda from those people those conservative we cool and hip people don hate gay do we this astonishing departure follow an implied but very clear assertion that ricca have repent and give up his activity an assertion that have absolutely no evidence to back it up we be simply ask to take the pope word for it but give that it follow his astoundingly brazen lie that there be no evidence for ricca homosexual activity in the first place we can take the assurance for what it seem to be worth next after another little inside nudge nudge wink wink joke about the gay lobby implying but of course never outright say that the whole thing be hysterical nonsense we hear direct contradiction to catholic teaching from no less source than his predecessor pope benedict ratzinger the problem be not have this tendency well actually your holiness yes it be particularly in the case of priest the tendency be call in the same catechism you quote intrinsically disorder and ratzinger be very clear that this tendency be sign of serious emotional dysfunction that must preclude man from be ordain squander the capital of trust few month ago in piece for the remnant talk about why the church and nearly all human society regard lie as sin mistake many make about lie be to understand it only in term of morality but thomas make the point that it be first matter of metaphysic lie be an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality thomistic theology teach that it be by lie that we become most like the devil and most unlike god because we be try to change the nature of reality to suit our own purpose habitual lie in effect change you into different kind of be one that be by nature an opponent of truth order against truth this of course mean that person whose orientation as we might say be towards falsehood even when he be at any give moment say something true be still service his lie he tell the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality it be not by violence but by lie and manipulation by issue half truth and pretend to be the kind of man he be not that shakespeare character iago earn the title of most evil character in english literature human being be naturally order towards the truth and we have to work at assume lie this be why confidence trickster can be successful why lie work for get what you want people don see it come the first natural assumption be trust at least at the basic level of expect truth most of the time we therefore instinctively see lie as betrayal of trust consider how much trust the catholic faithful have in the papacy until about how much un earn trust francis start with just by be elect this pontificate should be remember as one of the great confidence scam in history believe catholic have watch aghast as this pope have habitually trample on every aspect of catholic teaching sandro magister recently publish piece on his website that list in dizzying detail the many time in only the last few month that pope francis have falsify with obvious intention the word of christ in scripture and the teaching of the church of course this would be of little interest to secular journalist who have pay no mind to his habit of rewrite catholicism but the sex abuse crisis be something secular journalist be very interested in fact bergoglio seem not to have understand it be now irrefutable that pope bergoglio be habitual liar that in fact truth like reality seem to mean nothing to he except as tool sociologist talk about the concept of the high trust society one in which citizen believe what they be tell by the elite and trust they to govern and protect they adequately they warn that the general loss of trust in institution lead to general state of chaos in which law on the book matter little as citizen turn to their last resort of protect themselves and their own family this be the way society disintegrate it have be say many time that the sex abuse crisis have create massive loss of trust in prelate among the catholic faithful and this be true with professional confidence trickster on the papal throne blatantly use lie and manipulation to maintain power and ram through an agenda at radical variance with catholic doctrine how long before that predictable disintegration occur be we see it already be we see it in the declaration of this or that episcopate on amoris laetitia and communion for divorced and civilly remarry catholic with cardinal marx and other promote blessing for same sex union be we go to be see an escalation of it have see veritable chorus of catholic on social medium declare that if paul vi be canonise their loss of faith in the church as an institution will be complete be tell from contact inside the vatican that after the trip to chile bergoglio support have completely dry up he have no more resource of trust even among the people he have choose to surround himself with and after the report of cardinal sandri go toe to toe with he in shout match it seem that perhaps even his legendary vicious temper tantrum be fail to have the desire effect of terrorise his subordinate into submission marie collin by no stretch even conservative catholic echo this concern say the barros affair have definitely undermine credibility trust and hope in francis all can say be that people who have lot of hope in this particular pope and be talk about just ordinary catholic that know in my own parish would find it very difficult now and can not understand and can not believe that this particular pope have say the thing he have say in the last few week she tell the national catholic reporter it may seem like moment to enjoy see the apparently unbreachable shell of papal teflon finally crack but in reality this situation be potentially very harmful for soul in the long run there be multitude of problem this pontificate have create or make bad that we will be deal with for long time after bergoglio be go but perhaps one of the big one will be the destruction of trust already fracture since the collapse of all catholic institution after vatican ii and the horror of the sex abuse crisis how much will there be to repair of the once steadfast trust catholic instinctively have in the church after this note not one victim have come forward in chile show the proof this be slander and calumny be that clear the book the dictator pope relate that regular meeting between the pope and dicastery head have be abolish and even high rank curia prefect be often unable to see the pope whose appointment be now completely control by the secretariat of state it be certainly clear that no one see the pope unless cardinal parolin approve which may be the reason cardinal zen in his effort to warn francis of the danger of vatican deal with the communist chinese government have to wait in the rain at wednesday general audience this be common in italian journalism that have somewhat different standard from that of the anglo world and drive the rest of we spare italians care about get general picture of what go on where anglo saxon be consider weirdly obsess with trivial detail though she never blame the pope marie collins complain that vatican officialdom have simply not implement the commission recommendation the time limit of the commission member be allow to lapse without renewal and though it be not dissolve formally the commission have cease to function with no word of any plan to revive it probably reference to the inzoli case in which francis overturn previous sentence of vatican tribunal after the priest now laicised approach some of the pope close advisor for help include cardinal coccopalmerio not that anyone in rome be try very hard sandro

be more isolated he need your support and your voice now more than ever be the time to demand justice and free speech for julian thank you no place to hide edwa glenn greenwald good price. buy new. as of edt detail dennis bernstein we continue our discussion of the case of julian assange now in the ecuadorian embassy in great britain john pilger it be great to talk to you again but it be profound tragedy john s way they be treat julian assange this prolific journalist and publisher who so many other journalist have depend on in the past he have be totally leave out in the cold to fend for himself john pilger have never know anything like it there be kind of eerie silence around the julian assange case julian have be vindicate in every possible way and yet he be isolate as few people be these day he be cut off from the very tool of his trade visitor aren allow be in london recently and couldn see he although speak to people who have see he rafael correa the former president of ecuador say recently that he regard what they be do to julian now as torture it be correa government that give julian political refuge which have be betray now by his successor the government lead by lenin moreno which be back to sucking up to the united states in the time honor way with julian as the pawn and victim should be constitutional hero but really it come down to the british government although he be still in foreign embassy and actually have ecuadorian nationality his right of passage out of that embassy should be guarantee by the british government the united nations work party on unlawful detention have make that clear britain take part in an investigation which determine that julian be political refugee and that great miscarriage of justice have be impose on he it be very good that you be do this dennis because even in the medium outside the mainstream there be this silence about julian the street outside the embassy be virtually empty whereas they should be full of people say that we be with you the principle involve in this case be absolutely clear cut number one be justice the injustice do to this man be legion both in term of the bogus swedish case and now the fact that he must remain in the embassy and can leave without be arrest extradite to the united states and end up in hell hole but it be also about frfreedom of speech bout our right to know which be enshrine in the united states constitution if the constitution be take literally julian would be constitutional hero actually instead understand the indictment they be try to concoct read like charge of espionage it so ridiculous that be the situation as see it dennis it be not happy one but it be one that people should rally to quickly db his journalistic brother be sound like his prosecutor they want to get behind russia gate freak like congressman adam schiff and mike pompeo who would like to see assange in jail forever or even execute how do you respond to journalist act like prosecutor some of whom use his material to do story this be terrible time for journalism jp you be absolutely right it be terrible time for journalism have never know anything quite like it in my career that say it be not new there have always be so call mainstream which really come down to great power in medium it have always exist particularly in the united states the pulitzer prize this year be award to the new york times and the washington post for witch hunting around russia gate they be praise for how deeply source their investigation be their investigation turn up not shred of real evidence to suggest any serious russian intervention in the election like webb the julian assange case remind of the gary webb case bob parry be one of gary webb few supporter in the medium webb dark alliance series contain evidence that cocaine trafficking be go on with the connivance of the cia later webb be hound by fellow journalist and unable to find work he eventually commit suicide the cia inspector general subsequently vindicate he now julian assange be long way from take his own life his resilience be remarkable but he be still human being and he have take such battering probably the hard thing for he to take be the utter hypocrisy of news organization like the new york times which publish the wikileak war log and cablegate the washington post and the guardian which have take vindictive delight in torment julian the guardian few year ago get pulitzer prize write about snowden but their coverage of snowden leave he in hong kong it be wikileak that got snowden out of hong kong and to safety professionally find this one of the most unsavory and immoral thing have see in my career the persecution of this man by huge medium organization which have draw great benefit from wikileak one of assange great tormentor the guardian luke harding make great deal of money with hollywood version of book that he and david lee write in which they basically attack their source suppose you have to be psychiatrist to understand all of this my understanding be that so many of these journalist be shamed. hey realize that wikileak have do what they should have do long time ago and that be to tell we how government lie db one thing that disturb greatly be the way in which the western corporate press speculate about russian involvement in the election that it be hack through julian assange any serious investigator would want to know who would be motivate and yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so piss off people who go to work for the clinton machine and learn from the inside that the dnc be all about getting rid of bernie sander this be not part of the story eight hundred thousand disclosure on russia jp what happen to sander and the way that he be roll by the clinton organization everybody know that this be the story and now we have the dnc suing wikileak there kind of farcical element to this mean none of this come from the russians that wikileak be somehow in bed with the russians be ludicrous wikileak publish about, major disclosure about russia some of they extremely critical of the russian government if you be government and you be do something untoward or you be lie to your people and wikileak get the document to show it they will publish no matter who you be be they the united states or russia db randy credico because of his work and his decision to devote very high profile series to the persecution of julian assange recently find himself under attack he go to the white house press roast and after have nice discussion with congressman schiff he yell out what about julian assange the room be pack full of reporter but randy be attack and drag out it be if everyone there be embarrassed to recognize that one of their brother be be brutalize jp randy shout some truth it be very similar to what happen to ray mcgovern ray be former member of the cia but extremely principled might suggest he be renegade now db it be hysterical to watch these four armed guard who keep shout stop resist stop resist and they be beat the hell out of he jp think the image of ray be haul off be particularly tell these four overweight obviously ill train young man manhandle ray who be year old there be something highly emblematic about that for he stand up to challenge the fact that the cia be about to hand over leadership to person who have be in charge of torture it be both shocking and surreal which of course the julian assange case be as well but real journalism should be able to get through the shocking and the surreal and get to the truth there be so much collusion now with all these dark and menacing development it be almost as if the word journalism be becoming blight db there have certainly be lot of collusion when it come to israel then the word collusion be quite appropriate jp that the ultimate collusion but that collusion with silence never have there be collusion like the one between the and israel it suggest another word and that be immunity it have moral immunity cultural immunity geopolitical immunity legal immunity and certainly medium immunity we see the gunning down of over people on the day of the inauguration of the new embassy in jerusalem israel have some of the most wickedly experimental munition in the world and they fire they at people who be protest the occupation of their homeland and try to remind people of the nakba and the right of return in the medium these be describe as clash although they do become so bad that the new york times in later edition change its front page headline to say that israel be actually kill people rare moment indeed when the immunity the collusion be interrupt all the talk of iran and nuclear weapon be without any reference to the big nuclear power in the middle east db what would you say have be the contribution that julian assange have make in this age of censorship and cowardice in journalism where do he come into the picture jp think it come down to information if you go back to when wikileak start when julian be sit in his hotel room in paris begin to put the whole thing together one of the first thing he write be that there be morality in transparency that we have right to know what those who wish to control our life be do in secret the right to know what government be do in our name on our behalf or to our detriment be our moral right julian feel very passionately about this there be time when he could have compromise slightly in order to possibly help his situation there be time when say to he why don you just suspend that for while and go along with it of course know beforehand what his answer would be and that be no the enormous amount of information that have come from wikileak particularly in recent year have amount to an extraordinary public service be read just the other day wikileak cable from the embassy in caraca which be address to other agency in the region this be four year after the try to get rid of chavez in coup it detail how subversion should work of course they dress it up as human right work and so on be read this official document think how the information contain in it be worth year of the kind of distorted reporting from venezuela it also remind we that so call meddling by russia in the be just nonsense the word meddle doesn apply to the kind of action imply in this document it be intervention in another country affair wiwikileak have do that all over the world it have give people the information they have right to have they have right to find out from the so call war log the criminality of our war in afghanistan and iraq they have right to find out about cablegate at when on clinton watch we learn that the nsa be gather personal information on member of the united nations security council include their credit card number you can see why julian make enemy but he should also have make huge number of friend this be critical information because it tell we how power work and we will never learn about it otherwise think wikileak have open world of transparency and put flesh on the expression right to know this must explain why he be attack so much because that be so threaten the enemy to great power be not the like of the taliban it be we db and who can forget the release of the collateral murder footage by chelsea manning jp that kind of thing be not uncommon vietnam be mean to be the open war but really it wasn there weren the camera around it be indeed shocking information but it inform people and we have chelsea man courage to thank for that db yes and the thank he get be seven year in solitary confinement they want to prosecute assange and maybe hang he from the rafter in congress but what about judith miller and the new york times lie the west into war there be no end of horrific example of what pass for journalism in contrast to the amazing contribution that julian assange have make click here to listen to this

if you go back to when wikileak start when julian be sit in his hotel room in paris begin to put the whole thing together one of the first thing he write be that there be morality in transparency that we have right to know what those who wish to control our life be do in secret the right to know what government be do in our name on our behalf or to our detriment be our moral right julian feel very passionately about this there be time when he could have compromise slightly in order to possibly help his situation there be time when say to he why don you just suspend that for while and go along with it of course know beforehand what his answer would be and that be no the enormous amount of information that have come from wikileak particularly in recent year have amount to an extraordinary public service be read just the other day wikileak cable from the embassy in caraca which be address to other agency in the region this be four year after the try to get rid of chavez in coup it detail how subversion should work of course they dress it up as human right work and so on be read this official document think how the information contain in it be worth year of the kind of distorted reporting from venezuela it also remind we that so call meddling by russia in the be just nonsense the word meddle doesn apply to the kind of action imply in this document it be intervention in another country affair wiwikileak have do that all over the world it have give people the information they have right to have they have right to find out from the so call war log the criminality of our war in afghanistan and iraq they have right to find out about cablegate at when on clinton watch we learn that the nsa be gather personal information on member of the united nations security council include their credit card number you can see why julian make enemy but he should also have make huge number of friend this be critical information because it tell we how power work and we will never learn about it otherwise think wikileak have open world of transparency and put flesh on the expression right to know this must explain why he be attack so much because that be so threaten the enemy to great power be not the like of the taliban it be we db and who can forget the release of the collateral murder footage by chelsea manning jp that kind of thing be not uncommon vietnam be mean to be the open war but really it wasn there weren the camera around it be indeed shocking information but it inform people and we have chelsea man courage to thank for that db yes and the thank he get be seven year in solitary confinement they want to prosecute assange and maybe hang he from the rafter in congress but what about judith miller and the new york times lie the west into war there be no end of horrific example of what pass for journalism in contrast to the amazing contribution that julian assange have make click here to listen to this interviewthe eerie silence",0

100,it no secret that the trump administration have strong distaste for iran iran be one of the only issue on which the president have remain relatively consistent trump berate the country both before and after take office however trump anti iran strategy go against the well judgment of even the most anti iranian advisor in his staff who don want to see the isolate on the world stage fortunately for trump however he be not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize iran at all cost on december trump ambassador to the nikki haley give grandiose speech demonize iran that echo colin powell infamous performance before the in haley essential claim be that saudi arabia be under attack by missile supply to yemen by the iranian government and that the world should not sit idly by as this go on if we do nothing about the missile fire at saudi arabia we will not be able to stop the violence haley warn there be clear evidence that the missile that land on saudi arabia come to libya she say the evidence be undeniable the weapon might as well have have make in iran sticker all over it buy gold at discount price however even as haley open her mouth many commentator could already identify number of issue with her speech as common dream reza marashi explain haley cite un report in her claim regard iranian missile transfer to the houthis of course the un have reach no such conclusion and panel of expert conclude that fire missile fragment show component from an iranian company but they have no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier ask about haley claim that iran be the culprit sweden ambassador to the un say the info have be less clear analyst from the department of defense speak to reporter at haley speech openly acknowledge that they do not know the missile origin perhaps most surreal be the very same un report cite by haley also say the missile include component that be manufacture by an american company do she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remark or fail to read the entire un report the world may never know regardless of the fact that haley misrepresent the report in question it appear the entire premise of the report be almost completely incorrect anyway accord to former inspector scott ritter ritter write the missile debris in question actually contradict the finding of the un panel which hold that the missile launch against saudi arabia have be transfer to yemen in piece and assemble there by houthi missile engineer it be clear that the missile in question have be in the possession of yemen well before the saudi arabian lead intervention of and that their source be either soviet or north korean the modification kit on the other hand appear to be of iranian origin and be transport to yemen via oman the un panel claim not to have any evidence of external missile specialist work alongside the houthi indeed the simplicity of the burkhan modification concept be such that anyone already familiar with the scud missile system would be able to implement the require process without outside assistance emphasis add so where do the missile come from and who make they accord to ritter rather than the iranian

101,it no secret that the trump administration have strong distaste for iran iran be one of the only issue on which the president have remain relatively consistent trump berate the country both before and after take office however trump anti iran strategy go against the well judgment of even the most anti iranian advisor in his staff who don want to see the isolate on the world stage fortunately for trump however he remains not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize iran at all cost on december trump ambassador to the nikki haley give grandiose speech demonize iran that echo colin powell infamous performance before the in haley essential claim be that saudi arabia be under account by missile supply to yemen by the iranian government and that the world should not sit idly by as this go on if we do nothing about the missile fire at saudi arabia we will not be able to stop the violence haley warn there be clear evidence that the missile that land on saudi territory come from iran she say the evidence be undeniable the weapon might as well have have make in iran sticker all over it buy gold at discount price however even as haley open her mouth many commentator could already identify number of issue with her speech as common dream reza marashi explain haley cite un report in her claim regard iranian missile transfer to the houthis of course the un have reach no such conclusion instead panel of expert conclude that fire missile fragment show component from an iranian company but they have no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier ask about haley claim that iran be the culprit sweden ambassador to the un say the info have be less clear analyst from the department of defense speak to reporter at haley speech openly acknowledge that they do not know the missile origin perhaps most surreal be the very same un report cite by haley also say the missile include component that be manufacture by an american company do she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remark or fail to read the entire un report the world may never know regardless of the fact that haley misrepresent the report in question it appear the entire premise of the report be almost completely incorrect anyway accord to former inspector scott ritter ritter write the missile debris in question actually contradict the finding of the un panel which hold that the missile launch against saudi arabia have be transfer to yemen in piece and assemble there by houthi missile engineer it be clear that the missile in question have be in the possession of yemen well before the saudi arabian lead intervention of and that their source be either soviet or north korean the modification kit on the other hand appear to be of iranian origin and be transport to yemen via oman the un panel claim not to have any evidence of external missile specialist work alongside the houthi indeed the simplicity of the burkhan modification concept be such that anyone already familiar with the scud missile system would be able to implement the require process without outside assistance emphasis add so where do the missile come from and who make they accord to ritter rather than the

heap up bureaucracy common formation course between monastery develop by religious psychologist ever more power hand to federation this be federate carmelite monastic life under pope francis new paradigm of fully implement vaticantwoism very little be say of any effort be make to increase vocational outreach use the internet or through diocesan contact and perhaps most telling of all not one word be offer of apply any systematic religious solution no one be suggest increase prayer or fast rosary campaign or novena in what have to be the carmelite order most desperate hour nothing be say of increase intensity of devotion to the charism study of the foundress or return to source still less of strengthen the carmelite traditional independent self governance or reconsider the wisdom of the path take indeed in one case in spain the sister themselves advocate abandon traditional teresian autonomy altogether the report from great britain note carmel have close in the last year there have be two amalgamation in recent year and another one involve three carmel be in process two community at present be live together in one monastery as temporary measure the case of the netherlands be downright bizarre sister so old that even the federation structure be break down only one fully autonomous function carmel still exist in the netherlands and the remain of four each community be live in single care home run by religious brother but in this situation the solution undertake have be an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle include gain approval from rome for completely new structure whose main task no doubt will be the making of funeral arrangement and dispose of library book the atmosphere be weirdly resign one federation report recommend simply forget the number with many note of mutual congratulation over unity the creating of link and the building of trust and dialogue between community the report from belgium federate in average age with one sister in formation for monastery state tersely that their big problem be age but under possible solution say only we want to continue along the path we have begin it be only in the report from croatia where the problem change abruptly from age nun and no vocation to too many vocation with not enough room it be also notable that it be only in the croatian report that christ get direct mention federation of croatia bosnia herzegovina nun in convent with an average age of and eleven in formation this outlier differ from the western european federation in several respect notably that it be only federate in but the effect of the federate formation course be already be feel nowadays two monastery have difficulty because of lack of vocation path take have make foundation in albania however this community be not federate from the beginning our association have organize formation course for the young sister as well as course of permanent formation each year we have one or two seminar which be also the occasion to the meeting of the council of the association the duration be to day and they take place every time in different monastery of the association we invite the sister of other carmelite convent friend to our formation course sister from albania slovenia and bulgaria present problem in general in our association the vocation continue grow but there be difference between the monastery nowadays two monastery have difficulty because of lack of vocation possible solution we do all what be in our hand in the area of the vocational promotion collaborate in this way with christ who call by his spirit these self generate report be make in response to questionnaire set out for the meeting all speak of nothing but bureaucratic response share formation course meeting of superior amalgamation and suppression of house and finally care home and house give over entirely as infirmary tale of control systematized extinction federation germany date when erect number of convent number of nun solemnly profess in formation average age path take for year they have organize formation course on go initial formation and for formator meeting for prioress present problem have get very old some sister be

month long intensive course accord to the ratio give by the same sister of the federation in they establish carmelite infirmary to help the community course have be organize to accompany the young sister of the federation give by religious psychologist present problem age of the sister and lack of vocation we have not arrive at any practical conclusion in the way of amalgamations restructuring though attempt have be make the incorporation of sister from other country without due discernment in some case possible solution we be make enquiry federation spain catalonia date when erect number of convent number of nun solemnly profess in formation none average age what have be do there have be one suppression and two convent have amalgamate present problem age of the sister and lack of

year course on on go formation and one for those recently profess there have be suppression and amalgamation work will continue in this area in order to keep balance within the community base on the present community and the new vocation present problem age of the community result in weakening of life in all its facet it be not easy to express the reality lack of vocation be with we as reality in everyday life moreover the high number of carmel make difficult to maintain all presence possible solution it be completely necessary to assume the way of the restructuring in order to live what be essential forget the number the challenge to grow in confidence and communion should lead we to downgrade the famous and untouchable autonomy because to daughter of saint teresa the really important thing be to look for he and to live in obedience another of our challenge be care for the ecclesial presence we think this be the way will lead we to recreate from the interior the charism of the mother teresa federation france toulouse bordeaux date when erect number of convent abroad athens number of nun solemnly profess in formation average age, what have be do there have be amalgamation suppression the federal priority be the formation there have be lot of work in formation for prioress formator initial also with the extern sister the infirmary carmel be close due to the difficulty of find prioress and other personnel the sister have go to other carmel except some who have go to state geriatric home federation italy lombardy date when erect number of convent number of nun solemnly profess in formation average age present problem there be big difference between the various convent the number of vocation have diminish quickly and the number increase of those who have leave during formation and during the first year of solemn profession nonetheless there have not be amalgamation or suppression in some convent old age be real concern possible solution they be work on formation through course also on communion between the community there be meeting of the council with the community we be ready to accept sister who can not be care for in their own community however this have not be accept because they do not want to be separate the strange report come from the netherlands where for single survive autonomous monastery and an average age of resource be mobilise to create completely new structure complete with approval from the congregation for religious federation netherland date when erect number of convent number of nun solemnly profess in formation average age nb the bold be in the original what have be do dutch carmel and one in iceland have unite in federation this have create close communion from the beginning everyone have collaborate in the process of amalgamation and suppression present problem only one carmel function fully autonomously in the netherlands community be in care home run by the brother of the immaculate conception another carmel be renew in at the original carmel an infirmary wing have be add for those sister who require nursing it be run by franciscan sister with the passing of time the assembly of the federation have transfer task to the president of the federation accord to the faculty describe in the statute in particular regard our mutual solidarity also with the passing of the year the congregation for religious have place responsibility directly into the hand of the council of the federation finally the autonomous carmel have ask help from the federation in order to protect their interest due to our very advanced age in the netherland we have reach the moment when general assembly be no long possible we be leave with the problem that in the community there be no sister who can or who want to be prioress or council sister the structure of the federation that we have have till now be thus no long possible possible solution the federation council the religious assistant together with canon lawyer of the dutch conference of religious have work hard on completely new structure in which in its first draft the autonomy of the carmel have be constantly keep in mind we begin from three point maintenance of the formal autonomy of the carmel that still exist but with the chance to transfer task gradually to the council of the federation appointment of the federal board or federal council of the federation preferably appoint by the superior general the team will consist of president and vice president who be member of one of the convent appoint to function and of three people who be member or not of one of the convent supervisory council also to be appoint periodically by the superior general which will be make up of three member whose president will be preferably member of religious institute preferably of the carmelite order and appoint to function this council see itself as supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the assembly of the federation in october the president the religious assistant and lawyer be in rome where they explain the proposal they have meeting with fr general and with the congregation for religious these be open meeting that help we to clarify matter an important concern be that they would allow we to use lay people on the federal council of the federation and the supervisory council we be aware that we be not deal with simple matter but we think that in view of our present situation today we do not have much choice it be important to continue to protect the interest of our federation in the most responsible and careful way so that all the sister even those advanced in year can continue to live their life in carmel definitive permission come at the th of february give this incredible picture of carmelite order in the last rattle of its death throe the rest of the summary of speech give at the meeting in avila read as outright surreal leave we to wonder if any of these people be attach in any way to reality sr enrica rosanna the representative of the vatican congregation for religious tell they that the two great challenge to our contemplative life be the challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy she warn the nun against bring vocation from other country to keep their monastery alive drop hint about what now seem to be particular obsession of the congregation cor orans would take this subject up definitively in the nun be exhort to stay awake to welcome the dawn of bright new future these be difficult and uncertain time but it be also the time to stay awake as the new dawn be already announce itself our aim must be to be open to the future we should not forget that we be follow in the tradition of teresa of jesus and in the tradition of all those who have follow in her footstep it be wide road that open up before we we must be woman of hope and faith we must always believe that god be the one who direct history from this derive our task to be creative and at the same time faithful creative fidelity emphasis in the original while there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the carmelite order in western europe be foremost in the mind of the nun present it seem that the issue be simply not address out loud by the representative of the bureaucracy instead sr enrica after this bizarre and cryptic comment speak of the problem and difficulty that we can encounter in discernment of mostly non existent vocation include consumerism modern mean of communication difficulty in create stable personality autonomy of the young the need to be always support the ideology of subjectivism what be these people smoke give that this be three year or more from the abdication of benedict and the installation of the new paradigm of francis kasper one wonder what this new dawn be actually about perhaps useful question for one of the nun present could have be new dawn of what exactly this kind of code language have be popular with the progressivist faction in the church since the when the expectation be for the installation of totally new church be sr enrica somehow anticipate the fulfillment of those hippie era dream in the year to come it be certainly clear from francis first act as pope that he have deal with conservative and traditionalist nun high on his list of priority his first appointment no more than three week after the conclave be jose rodrigue carballo the religious congregation secretary and give the scandal that erupt on his leave they the financial wreck ball of the franciscan friar minor the first task francis give carballo be the demolition of the franciscan friar of the immaculate certainly this record of the european carmelite meeting be jammed with hint that cor orans be on the way on the final day of the meeting the theme for the day be offer by then father general luis arostegui government the need for change autonomy and association autonomy and fr general other solution to government the devolution of authority of superior of individual monastery to federation be obviously on someone mind as be plan to see to it that monastery change superior frequently essential autonomy can fail due to the relationship within the community abuse by permanent superior who decide on the freedom and decision of the community the father

have be two amalgamation in recent year and another one involve three carmel be in process two community at present be live together in one monastery as temporary measure the case of place netherlands be downright bizarre sister so old that even the federation structure be break down only one fully autonomous function but still exist in the netherlands and the remain of four entire community be live in single care home run by religious brother but in this situation the solution undertake have be an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle include gain approval from rome for completely new structure whose main task no doubt will be the making of funeral arrangement and dispose of library book the atmosphere be weirdly resign one federation report recommend simply forget the number with many note of mutual congratulation over unity the creating of link and the building of trust and dialogue between community the report from belgium federate in average age with one sister in formation for monastery state tersely that their big problem be age but under possible solution say only we want to continue along the path we have begin it be only in the report from croatia where the problem change abruptly from age nun and no vocation to too many vocation with not enough room it be also notable that it be only in the croatian report that christ get direct mention federation of croatia bosnia herzegovina nun in convent with an average age of and eleven in formation this outlier differ from the western european federation in several respect notably that it be only federate in but the effect of the federate formation course be already be feel nowadays two monastery have difficulty because of lack of vocation path take have make foundation in albania however this community be not federate from the beginning our association have organize formation course for the young sister as well as course of permanent formation each year we have one or two seminar which be also the occasion to the meeting of the council of the association the duration be to day and they take place every time in different monastery of the association we invite the sister of other carmelite convent friend to our formation course sister from albania slovenia and bulgaria present problem in general in our association the vocation continue grow but there be difference between the monastery nowadays two monastery have difficulty because of lack of vocation possible solution we do all what be in our hand in the area of the vocational promotion collaborate in this way with christ who call by his spirit these self generate report be make in response to questionnaire set out for the meeting all speak of nothing but bureaucratic response share formation course meeting of superior amalgamation and

though attempt have be make the incorporation of sister from other country without due discernment in some case possible solution we be make enquiry federation spain catalonia date when erect number

year course on on go formation and one for those recently profess there have be suppression and amalgamation work will continue in this area in order to keep balance within the community base on the present community and the new vocation present problem age of the community result in weakening of life in all its facet it be not easy to express the reality lack of vocation be with we as reality in everyday life moreover the high number of carmel make difficult to maintain all presence possible solution it be completely necessary to assume the way of the restructuring in order to live what be essential forget the number the challenge to grow in confidence and communion should lead we to downgrade the famous and untouchable autonomy because to daughter of saint teresa the really important thing be to look for he and to live in obedience another of our challenge be care for the ecclesial presence we think this be the way will lead we to recreate from the interior the charism of the mother teresa federation france toulouse bordeaux date when erect number of convent abroad athens number of nun solemnly profess in formation average age, what have be do there have be amalgamation suppression the federal priority be the formation there have be lot of work in formation for prioress formator initial also with the extern sister the infirmary carmel be close due to the difficulty of find prioress and other personnel the sister have go to other carmel except some who have go to state geriatric home federation italy lombardy date when erect number of convent number of nun solemnly profess in formation average age present problem there be big difference between the various convent the number of vocation have diminish quickly and the number increase of those who have leave during formation and during the first year of solemn profession nonetheless there have not be amalgamation or suppression in some convent old age be real concern possible solution they be work on formation through course also on communion between the community there be meeting of the council with the community we be ready to accept sister who can not be care for in their own community however this have not be accept because they do not want to be separate the strange report come from the netherlands where for single survive autonomous monastery and an average age of resource be mobilise to create completely new structure complete with approval from the congregation for religious federation netherland date when erect number of convent number of nun solemnly profess in formation average age nb the bold be in the original what have be do dutch carmel and one in iceland have unite in federation this have create close communion from the beginning everyone have collaborate in the process of amalgamation and suppression present problem only one carmel function fully autonomously in the netherlands community be in care home run by the brother of the immaculate conception another carmel be renew in at the original carmel an infirmary wing have be add for those sister who require nursing it be run by franciscan sister with the passing of time the assembly of the federation have transfer task to the president of the federation accord to the faculty describe in the statute in particular regard our mutual solidarity also with the passing of the year the congregation for religious have place responsibility directly into the hand of the council of the federation finally the autonomous carmel have ask help from the federation in order to protect their interest due to our very advanced age in the netherland we have reach the moment when general assembly be no long possible we be leave with the problem that in the community there be no sister who can or who want to be prioress or council sister the structure of the federation that we have have till now be thus no long possible possible solution the federation council the religious assistant together with canon lawyer of the dutch conference of religious have work hard on completely new structure in which in its first draft the autonomy of the carmel have be constantly keep in mind we begin from three point maintenance of the formal autonomy of the carmel that still exist but with the chance to transfer task gradually to the council of the federation appointment of the federal board or federal council of the federation preferably appoint by the superior general the team will consist of president and vice president who be member of one of the convent appoint to function and of three people who be member or not of one of the convent supervisory council also to be appoint periodically by the superior general which will be make up of three member whose president will be preferably member of religious institute preferably of the carmelite order and appoint to function this council see itself as supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the assembly of the federation in october the president the religious assistant and lawyer be in rome where they explain the proposal they have meeting with fr general and with the congregation for religious these be open meeting that help we to clarify matter an important concern be that they would allow we to use lay people on the federal council of the federation and the supervisory council we be aware that we be not deal with simple matter but we think that in view of our present situation today we do not have much choice it be important to continue to protect the interest of our federation in the most responsible and careful way so that all the sister even those advanced in year can continue to live their life in carmel definitive permission come at the th of february give this incredible picture of carmelite order in the last rattle of its death throe the rest of the summary of speech give at the meeting in avila read as outright surreal leave we to wonder if any of these people be attach in any way to reality sr enrica rosanna the representative of the vatican congregation for religious tell they that the two great challenge to our contemplative life be the challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy she warn the nun against bring vocation from other country to keep their monastery alive drop hint about what now seem to be particular obsession of the congregation cor orans would take this subject up definitively in the nun be exhort to stay awake to welcome the dawn of bright new future these be difficult and uncertain time but it be also the time to stay awake as the new dawn be already announce itself our aim must be to be open to the future we should not forget that we be follow in the tradition of teresa of jesus and in the tradition of all those who have follow in her footstep it be wide road that open up before we we must be woman of hope and faith we must always believe that god be the one who direct history from this derive our task to be creative and at the same time faithful creative fidelity emphasis in the original while there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the carmelite order in western europe be foremost in the mind of the nun present it seem that the issue be simply not address out loud by the representative of the bureaucracy instead sr enrica after this bizarre and cryptic comment speak of the problem and difficulty that we can encounter in discernment of mostly non existent vocation include consumerism modern mean of communication difficulty in create stable personality autonomy of the young the need to be always support the ideology of subjectivism what be these people smoke give that this be three year or more from the abdication of benedict and the installation of the new paradigm of francis kasper one wonder what this new dawn be actually about perhaps useful question for one of the nun present could have be new dawn of what exactly this kind of code language have be popular with the progressivist faction in the church since the when the expectation be for the installation of totally new church be sr enrica somehow anticipate the fulfillment of those hippie era dream in the year to come it be certainly clear from francis first act as pope that he have deal with conservative and traditionalist nun high on his list of priority his first appointment no more than three week after the conclave be jose rodrigue carballo the religious congregation secretary and give the scandal that erupt on his leave they the financial wreck ball of the franciscan friar minor the first task francis give carballo be the demolition of the franciscan friar of the immaculate certainly this record of the european carmelite meeting be jammed

autonomy and fr general other solution to government the devolution of authority of superior of individual monastery to federation be obviously on someone mind as be plan to see to it that monastery

source but this isn actually what their spam policy say here the policy we work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising fraud and security breach all of which detract from people ability of share and connect we do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to collect like follower or share do not artificially increase distribution for financial

existent facebook feature source the washington post originally say that these page be purge for push political message for profit as you can see by their url but of course since they too push political message for profit waaah trump as do all the other corporate medium outlet out there they change their headline to facebook purge over account and page for push political spam the fact that many of these account be also suspend by twitter shortly thereafter should tell you that this be coordinated effort to silence large swath of the population of course the good coverage of this be from russia sputnik news contact many of the alternative journalist who be purge to get their take on what happen you may recall that basically every blogger outside the establishment medium be accuse of be secretly russian during the election by the washington post so perhaps actual russians have vested interest in the truth come out on this topic my friend john vibe be an amazing person who contribute to the free thought project he say this signify re consolidation of the medium cable news medium control the narrative for most of modern history but the internet have lower that barrier to entry and allow the average person to become the medium themselves this obviously take market share and influence away from the traditional medium and it have allow for more diverse public conversation now it seem the platform that have monopolize the industry be favor mainstream source and silence alternative voice so now instead of allow more people to have voice these platform be create an atmosphere where only powerful medium organization be welcome just as we have on cable news people think that we be just provide an activist spin on the news but they don see the family struggle to have their voice hear for example when someone be shoot by police mainstream medium source often just republish the press release from the police department without present the victim side of the story we give the victim and their family voice which be essential to keep power in check this also go for big issue like foreign policy as well multiple full scale invasion of syria have be prevent because of information that the alternative medium make viral source nicholas bernabe of the antimedia be another alternative journalist consider friend and support wholeheartedly he work tirelessly to be voice of truth in world of lie he tell sputnik our approach generally be to cover story and angle that corporate medium underreport or misreport and to amplify activist and anti war voice and story all of our content be professionally fact check and edit get into this line of work because feel there be need for medium that challenge mainstream assumption and bias in politic want to shed light on corruption and wrongdoing against oppressed people and cover the harsh truth about american foreign policy over the last day we reach, people on facebook the timing of this purge be rather dubious in my view come shortly before the midterm election this could be an attempt by facebook itself to affect the outcome of the come election the twitter suspension catch by surprise can only speculate that these suspension be coordinated effort to stifle our message ahead of the come election source remember this be coordinate across multiple platform remember when this happen to alex jones back in september an assault be lead by youtube google and facebook against alex jones of infowar fame all of his account be shut down in quick succession follow by his credit card processing company and his newsletter service provider write at the time alex jones be just the beginning of this purge it go to get much bad meanwhile other dissent voice be be silence on social medium with limited reach and shadow ban infowar be massive profit machine but what happen when similar attack be launch on small alternative medium outlet it hit we right in the wallet and if they re hit hard enough they ll cease to be able to function jones have lot of money so this may not be the end of he but for most website owner this would be the absolute end of our ability to do business and to be able to bring the information we bring we do have to run our website as business it far more expensive than most people realize to run site know that my own operating cost every month be more than site as big as jones would be many time that amount when all your avenue of monetization be cut off it wouldn be hard for site and the dissent and information they share to cease to exist source this be not just about facebook or twitter it about the ability to find dissent information period google be in on it too leak document from google support the idea of censorship another google document have find its way into the public domain this time through breitbart the news publication report that an page briefing entitle the good censor advise tech company to police tone instead of content and to not take side when censor user google might continue to shift with the time change its stance on how much or how little it censor due to public governmental or commercial pressure if it do acknowledgment of what this shift in position mean for user and for google be essential shifting blindly or silently in one direction or another rightly incite user fury the google internal research even quote outside expert like george soros who express justification of censorship in non market note that google should police tone instead of content and censor everyone equally as breitbart put it source there be trillion google search per day per day that should give you an idea of the power of something like google combine it with billion of facebook and twitter user and you can easily see the influence wield here this be where free thought go to die ron paul remind we that truth be treason ron paul former senator and the libertarian voice of reason say when jones be purge you get accuse of treasonous activity and treasonous speech because in an empire of lie the truth be treason paul tell the russia base news outlet challenge the status quo be what they can stand and it unnerve they so they have to silence people some of we tell the truth about our government they call we treasonous and say we re speak out of line and they like to punish we and think that part of what happen with social medium paul tell rt add that he hope anti government or anti war voice can eliminate their dependency on the current social medium platform just hope that technology can stay ahead of it all and that we can have real alternative to the dependency on twitter and other company that have be work hand in glove with the government paul add source here video from last month with dr paul thought about the social medium purge in it he remind we that facebook be private entity so they do have every right to remove the page they wish the danger and the area in which this tread on the first amendment be their direct tie to the government this affect everyone if you re read this and you shrug because you personally don have twitter or facebook account you re miss the big point consider the fact that the population of facebook be big than the population of the us china and brazil combine that how many people will now only receive one side of the story on thing like war politic gun and current event people will believe what they re tell because there be no alternative information present there be no question ask it literally the textbook definition of brainwash definition of brainwash forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political social or religious belief and attitude and to accept contrast regiment idea persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship source here an article from psychology today that discuss how facebook be in fact brainwash people for profit social medium be massive source of information and influence today if the information be rig by entity that support socialism gun control and the end of privacy we re doom. billion active user will be bombard with these message without any real option for the other side of the story so regardless of whether you personally participate this will color popular sentiment to massive degree it will grow the cognitive dissonance that assure people of thing like the government be your friend and that you don need to protect yourself the police will take care of you people who hate freedom will get unfettered access to the mind of billion people that should scare the crap out of you what can you do about the alternative medium purge it possible but unlikely that social pressure on facebook and twitter will push the outlet into restore the account of these alternative medium network but even if they be restore suspect their reach will dwindle even far here be few thing you can subscribe to the newsletter of website you enjoy don count on see their work on social medium you can subscribe to my newsletter here incidentally support they financially if you can many site have patreon account or donate button bookmark they and visit regularly if they have ad your visit help they to make the money they need to stay afloat share their article on your own social medium account if they can get their work out there we can help join alternative social medium outlet like gab and mewe the truth be get hard and hard to find you re go to have to dig for it we re watch the big campaign against freedom of speech and think that have ever occur in our part of the world

diverse public conversation now it seem the platform that have monopolize the industry be favor mainstream source and silence alternative voice so now instead of allow more people to have voice these platform be create an atmosphere where only powerful medium organization be welcome just as we have on cable news people think that we be just provide an activist spin on the news but they don see the family struggle to have their voice hear for example when someone be shoot by police mainstream medium source often just republish the press release from the police department without present the victim side of the story we give the victim and their family voice which be essential to keep power in check this also go for big issue like foreign policy as well multiple full scale invasion of syria have be prevent because of information that the alternative medium make viral source nicholas bernabe of the antimedia be another alternative journalist consider friend and support wholeheartedly he work tirelessly to be voice of truth in world of lie he tell sputnik our approach generally be to cover story and angle that corporate medium underreport or misreport and to amplify activist and anti war voice and story all of our content be professionally fact check and edit get into this line of work because feel there be need for medium that challenge mainstream assumption and bias in politic want to shed light on corruption and wrongdoing against oppressed people and cover the harsh truth about american foreign policy over the last day we reach, people on facebook the timing of this purge be rather dubious in my view come shortly before the midterm election this could be an attempt by facebook itself to affect the outcome of the come election the twitter suspension catch by surprise can only speculate that these suspension be coordinated effort to stifle our message ahead of the come election source remember this be coordinate across multiple platform remember when this happen to alex jones back in september an assault be lead by youtube google and facebook against alex jones of infowar fame all of his account be shut down in quick succession follow by his credit card processing company and his newsletter service provider write at the time alex jones be just the beginning of this purge it go to get much bad meanwhile other dissent voice be be silence on social medium with limited reach and shadow ban infowar be massive profit machine but what happen when similar attack be launch on small alternative medium outlet it hit we right in the wallet and if they re hit hard enough they ll cease to be able to function jones have lot of money so this may not be the end of he but for most website owner this would be the absolute end of our ability to do business and to be able to bring the information we bring we do have to run our website as business it far more expensive than most people realize to run site know that my own operating cost every month be more than site as big as jones would be many time that amount when all your avenue of monetization be cut off it wouldn be hard for site and the dissent and information they share to cease to exist source this be not just about facebook or twitter it about the ability to find dissent information period google be in on it too leak document from google support the idea of censorship another google document have find its way into the public domain this time through breitbart the news publication report that an page briefing entitle the good censor advise tech company to police tone instead of content and to not take side when censor user google might continue to shift with the time change its stance on how much or how little it censor due to public governmental or commercial pressure if it do acknowledgment of what this shift in position mean for user and for google be essential shifting blindly or silently in one direction or another rightly incite user fury the google internal research even quote outside expert like george soros who express justification of censorship in non market note that google should police tone instead of content and censor everyone equally as breitbart put it source there be trillion google search per day per day that should give you an idea of the power of something like google combine it with billion of facebook and twitter user and you can easily see the influence wield here this be where free thought go to die ron paul remind we that truth be treason ron paul former senator and the libertarian voice of reason say when jones be purge you get accuse of treasonous activity and treasonous speech because in an empire of lie the truth be treason paul tell the russia base news outlet challenge the status quo be what they can stand and it unnerve they so they have to silence people some of we tell the truth about our government they call we treasonous and say we re speak out of line and they like to punish we and think that part of what happen with social medium paul tell rt add that he hope anti government or anti war voice can eliminate their dependency on the current social medium platform just hope that technology can stay ahead of it all and that we can have real alternative to the dependency on twitter and other company that have be work hand in glove with the government paul add source here video from last month with dr paul thought about the social medium purge in it he remind we that facebook be private entity so they do have every right to remove the page they wish the danger and the area in which this tread on the first amendment be their direct tie to the government this affect everyone if you re read this and you shrug because you personally don have twitter or facebook account you re miss the big point consider the fact that the population of facebook be big than the population of the us china and brazil combine that how many people will now only receive one side of the story on thing like war politic gun and current event people will believe what they re tell because there be no alternative information present there be no question ask it literally the textbook definition of brainwash definition of brainwash forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political social or religious belief and attitude and to accept contrast regiment idea persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship source here an article from psychology today that discuss how facebook be in fact brainwash people for profit social medium be massive source of information and influence today if the information be rig by entity that support socialism gun control and the end of privacy we re doom. billion active user will be bombard with these message without any real option for the other side of the story so regardless of whether you personally participate this will color popular sentiment to massive degree it will grow the cognitive dissonance that assure people of thing like the government be your friend and that you don need to protect yourself the police will take care of you people who hate freedom will get unfettered access to the mind of billion people that should scare the crap out of you what can you do about the alternative medium purge it possible but unlikely that social pressure on facebook and twitter will push the outlet into restore the account of these alternative medium network but even if they be restore suspect their reach will dwindle even far here be few thing you can subscribe to the newsletter of website you enjoy don count on see their work on social medium you can subscribe to my newsletter here incidentally support they financially if you can many site have patreon account or donate button bookmark they and visit regularly if they have ad your visit help they to make the money they need to stay afloat share their article on your own social medium account if they can get their work out there we can help join alternative social medium outlet like gab and mewe the truth be get hard and hard to find you re go to have to dig for it we re watch the big campaign against freedom of speech and think that have ever occur in our part of the world the alternative medium purge be just the beginning and we should all be very concerned article post with permission from daisy luthercoordinate alternative medium purge should terrify everyone soon those who hate freedom will have unquestione access to the mind of billion people",0

since do so would assume that christianity at some point be complete which faggioli do not think be true while emphatically disagree with this argument have to hand it to faggioli from the outset he make clear that he be not plan to debate douthat on the implication of the francis papacy instead through combination of rhetorical trick and soft peddle hegelianism he would completely redefine the role and nature of the catholic church during the crux of the debate the discussion of communion for the divorced and remarried faggioli raise his most theologically unsettling point to defend his position that remarry person should be able to receive communion faggioli invoke the case of germany where percent of catholic marriage end in divorce for faggioli the implication be that at least five of german catholic child never see their parent receive communion and lose their faith because of it this he say be bad for evangelization and in order to keep the pew full the church role should not be to deny communion to the divorced and remarried but instead to ask what can the catholic church do to make the faithful able to receive sacrament advertisement this be lovely suggestion and one that not entirely unsympathetic to however the fact remain that faggioli be suggest the church do much more than provide sacrament to the faithful just before invoke the german case faggioli characterize the country as one of the most secular in the world but rather than lament what secular ##ism have work on marital life in germany reassert the church position on marriage and insist that

man be use god and in reality even if it be not outwardly discernible he be place himself above god to fully drive the point home benedict equate this kind of worship with the israelites desert worship of the bull calf unsurprisingly this progressive interpretation of catholic doctrine eventually reveal itself to be rank historicism throughout the debate faggioli draw out the argument that

this question be priest throughout history in fact mislead their divorce and remarry parishioner by tell they they could not receive communion after few second pause faggioli give the only answer he

annas the high priest and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as be of the kindred of the high priest be gather together at jerusalem and when they have set they in the midst they ask by what power or by what name have ye do this then peter fill with the holy ghost say unto they ye ruler of the people and elder of israel if we this day be examine of the good deed do to the impotent man by what mean he be make whole be it know unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucify whom god raise from the dead even by he doth this man stand here before you whole this be the stone which be set at nought of you builder which be become the head of the corner neither be there salvation in any other for there be none other name under heaven give among man whereby we must be save now when they see the boldness of peter and john and perceive that they be unlearned and ignorant man they marvel and they take knowledge of they that they have be with jesus and behold the man which be heal stand with they they could say nothing against it but when they have command they to go aside out of the council they confer among themselves say what shall we do to these man for that indeed notable miracle hath be do by they be manifest to all they that dwell in jerusalem and we can not deny it but that it spread no far among the people let we straitly threaten they that they speak henceforth to no man in this name and they call they and command they not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus but peter and john answer and say unto they whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye for we can not but speak the thing which we have see and hear act or what of the account find in act where the lord send an angel to liberate peter from the hand of tyrant now about that time herod the king stretch forth his hand to vex certain of the church and he kill james the brother of john with the sword and because he see it please the jews he proceed far to take peter also then be the day of unleavened bread and when he have apprehend he he put he in prison and deliver he to four quaternion of soldier to keep he intend after easter to bring he forth to the people peter therefore be keep in prison but prayer be make without cease of the church unto god for he and when herod would have bring he forth the same night peter be sleep between two soldier bind with two chain and the keeper before the door keep the prison and behold the angel of the lord come upon he and light shined in the prison and he smite peter on the side and raise he up say arise up quickly and his chain fall off from his hand and the angel say unto he gird thyself and bind on thy sandal and so he do and he saith unto he cast thy garment about thee and follow and he go out and follow he and wist not that it be true which be do by the angel but think he see vision when they be past the first and the second ward they come unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which open to they of his own accord and they go out and pass on through one street and forthwith the angel depart from he and when peter be come to himself he say now know of surety that the lord hath send his angel and hath deliver out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews over and over again you can see that the church be to stand in protest against the wicked that be at war with christ revelation in deal with not only the corrupt and wicked priest but also the corrupt and wicked in government as well as those who submit to such it be important for people to know the scripture history lest you find yourself to be fight against god act nowhere in scripture can you find the lord

204,"la stampa robert fastiggi reply to chris ferrara article on fastiggi and goldstein defense of amoris laetitia and their criticism of the filial correction fastiggi exchange with ferrara concern wait wait it all mistranslation robert fastiggi hour ago in the article that co author with dr goldstein we would have do well to speak of the official latin text rather than the original latin text this though be before long an issue because the normative might be the latin text publish in thr aas mr ferrara however base his critique upon an assumption that the generous response offer to god be sin this though be not what al be say the generous response be move away from sin and move toward god explain this in my most recent response to prof christian brugger which can serve as my response to mr ferrara post on lifesitenews prof brugger be good theologian and fine man but he still seem to believe that al imply that god be ask people to continue to sin in some case in his april article in catholic world report brugger write that al suggest that god can be ask someone to live in life state in which they be objectively violate grave matter then in sept lifesitenew article he state that the generous response owe to god be certain state that be objectively at variance with the universal command of the gospel now prof brugger argue that because the subject remain this conscience in al this prove that the generous offering owe to god be the recognition that one be live contrary to the universal command of the gospel prof brugger fail to see that al clearly distinguish between conscience recognition that give situation be objectively at variance with the general mandate of the gospel and this same conscience subsequent recognition of generous response owe to god in the present circumstance the subject conscience might be the same but the object be different the generous response be not the situation that be at variance with the command of the gospel but an offering that god be ask amid the mass of impediment even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model what might be this generous response pope francis do not give an example in al because he speak in general term of the dynamic of conscience moreover he know that concrete case vary widely in our sept article in la stampa dr goldstein and provide hypothetical example of couple in purely civil marriage recognize that god be call they to live in continence we choose this date deliberately to demonstrate that the generous response could be the ending of particular sin our example be an attempt to show that professor br ##ugger and seifert be wrong to believe al imply that god be ask some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state it really just the opposite al teach that conscience will come to recognize that god be ask for step in the right direction away from sin pope francis explain this again in al when he say small step in the midst of great human limitation can be more pleasing to god than life which appear outwardly in order but move through the day without confront great difficulty in recent interview the italian philosopher rocco buttiglione provide this example for al imagine father who have sick son and the child improve he still have fever but have stop vomit the child manage to keep in his stomach what he eat and have start therapy that seem

beautiful and compassionate message of al have be so completely misunderstood by scholar who have fail to grasp its true meaning chris ferrara to robert fastiggi hour ago certainly agree that the latin text be the normative text even if it come later certainly do not agree that the latin text eliminate the grave problem with amoris laetitia rather as show in my article it only intensify they with all due respect to dr fastiggi his argument and that of buttiglione that move away from sin be what be pleasing to god even if the moral norm be not adhere to be sophistical what constitute move away from sin if not cease to commit the sin no example be provide in al because none can be the notion be nonsensical just how nonsensical be demonstrate by dr fastiggi claim that by move away from sin in the case of divorced and remarried couple francis mean their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of child but that would be cease to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandon the pretense that they be marry along with the illicit sexual relation itself such couple could always be absolve and receive holy communion under the church constant practice albeit privately to avoid scandal at any rate the brother and sister approach to the situation which be that of familiaris consortio be certainly not the one advocate by francis as my article show francis have make it quite clear that he approve of admit to the sacrament divorce and remarry people who will continue to live as if they be marry include sexual relation while discern their situation this discernment be mere fig leaf to conceal the propose toleration of public adultery in the church thus francis thank the maltese bishop for their al guideline which literally mandate admission to the sacrament of divorced and remarry people who believe themselves to be at peace with god and as he tell the bishop of bueno aire in writing there be no other

robert fastiggi to chris ferrara hour ago thank you for your response you write well but you do not reveal proper understanding of what pope francis be say in al can only ask that you to study the matter more carefully with an open heart and mind chris ferrara to robert fastiggi minute ago tell that to the four cardinal the, faithful the theologian and the other original signer of the correctio all of whom you insult with your superficial and must say entirely sophistical attempt to explain away what francis be clearly do irony of irony the latter day pharisees and legalists francis see around every corner be hard at work defend amoris laetitia at the very moment it be be cite by bishop after bishop as their sole authority for admit public adulterer to holy communion while francis do nothing but approve think you should follow your own advice about study this matter with an open heart and mind but above all with open eye for you have clearly shut they to what be go in the diocese in the name of al fastiggi exchange with ferrara concern more fake news la stampa try again robert fastiggi hour ago would like to thank christopher ferrara again for call attention to an article co author with dr goldstein in la stampa give he credit for his colorful style unfortunately mr ferrara provide no real evidence for his claim that pope francis wish the bishop to admit public adulterer in second marriage to the sacrament while continue their adulterous relation he mention the holy father's letter to the bueno air bishop but he fail to take into account that the statement of those argentine bishop can be interpret in an orthodox way as cardinal muller tell edward pentin in sept interview publish in the national catholic register in fact the statement of the argentine bishop only speak of the possibility of access to the sacrament of reconciliation and the eucharist this could reasonably be interpret as go to confession before receive holy communion the same apply to statement of pope francis and cardinal schoenborn mention by ferrara pope francis defer to the exposition of amoris laetitia by cardinal schoenborn give in april when the exhortation be make public have read the cardinal's exposition in both italian and english and only find mention of the help of the sacrament in certain case once again mr ferrara assume this mean access to holy communion without prior sacramental confession with regard to the letter thank the bishop of malta it should be note that edward pentin mention letter of cardinal baldiserri not letter of pope francis moreover this letter have not be make public so we do not know exactly what it say other than an expression of thank this seem to be very thin evidence for claim pope francis wish the bishop to admit public adulterer to the sacrament while continue in their adulterous relation as lawyer ferrara should have well sense of what really count as evidence as christian he should also be mindful of the command against bear false witness beyond these consideration wish to express personal concern have about mr ferrara's standing in the catholic church he say that dr goldstein and be foot soldier of leviathan church because we defend the roman pontiff do mr ferrara believe that the catholic church under pope francis be leviathan church and not the catholic church if this be so then it would suggest that mr ferrara be refuse submission to the roman pontiff and communion with the member of the church subject to he this though be the very definition of schism find in the catechism of the catholic church and the cic canon hope mr ferrara can clarify what he mean by the leviathan church under pope francis more simple question to he would be this be you refuse submission to the roman pontiff or communion with the member subject to he apologize ahead of time if misconstrue his word believe though my question be reasonable in light of his reference to leviathan church distinct from the dictate of the immortal god in heaven chris ferrara to robert fastiggi hour ago if dr fastiggi wish to continue to pretend despite grow mountain of evidence that pope francis have not in fact approve of the admission of public adulterer to holy communion just as he do when archbishop of bueno aire and just as he do with the woman he telephone in argentina then can not help he as for my metaphorical reference to leviathan church be afraid dr fastiggi have succumb to an unfortunate literal mindedness to make it clear for he be contend that he and his co author treat the pope as if he be the absolute ruler of hobbes leviathan do not as should be obvious argue that this leviathan church actually exist that it do not and can not exist be precisely my point dr fastiggi inapt citation to canon and his clumsy and insulting question about my standing in the catholic church and whether be refuse submission to the roman pontiff demonstrate pronounced lack of comprehension of pertinent ecclesiological and theological basic and rather embarrassing lack of rhetorical finesse raise objection to papal document because it appear to depart from sound orthodoxy be hardly refuse submission to the roman pontiff who have not at any rate actually command anyone to submit to anything via al respectfully suggest that dr fastiggi comment evince need for serious study and reflection before he

205,"la stampa robert fastiggi reply to chris ferrara article on fastiggi and goldstein defense of amoris laetitia and their criticism of the filial correction fastiggi exchange with ferrara concern wait wait it all mistranslation robert fastiggi hour ago in the article that co author with dr goldstein we would have do well to speak of the official latin text rather than the original latin text this though be no long an issue may the normative text be the latin text publish in thr aas mr ferrara however base his critique upon an assumption that the generous response offer to god be sin this though be not what al be say the generous response be move away from sin and move toward god explain this in my most recent response to prof christian brugger which can serve as my response to mr ferrara post on lifesitenews prof brugger be good theologian and fine man but he still seem to believe that al imply that god be ask people to continue to sin in some case in his april article in catholic world report brugger write that al suggest that god can be ask someone to live in life state in which they be objectively violate grave matter then in sept lifesitenew article he state that the generous response owe to god be certain state that be objectively at variance with the universal command of the gospel now prof brugger argue that because the subject remain this conscience in al this prove that the generous offering owe to god be the recognition that one be live contrary to the universal command of the gospel prof brugger fail to see that al clearly distinguish between conscience recognition that the situation be objectively at variance with the general mandate of the gospel and this same conscience subsequent recognition of generous response owe to god in the present circumstance the subject conscience might be the same but the object be different the generous response be not some situation that be at variance with the command of the gospel but an offering that god be ask amid the mass of impediment even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model what might be this generous response pope francis do not give an example in al because he speak in general term of the dynamic of conscience moreover he know that concrete case vary widely in our sept article in la stampa dr goldstein and provide hypothetical example of couple in purely civil marriage recognize that god be call they to live in continence we choose this example deliberately to demonstrate that the generous response could be the ending of particular sin our example be an attempt to show that professor br ##ugger and seifert be wrong to believe al imply that god be ask some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state it really just the opposite al teach that conscience will come to recognize that god be ask for step in the right direction away from sin pope francis explain this again in al when he say small step in the midst of great human limitation can be more pleasing to god than life which appear outwardly in order but move through the day without confront great difficulty in recent interview the italian philosopher rocco buttiglione provide this example for al imagine father who have sick son and the child improve he still have fever but have stop vomit the child manage to keep in his stomach what he eat and have start therapy that seem to work the father be happy be he happy about the fact that the child be sick no he be pleased that his son give symptom of improvement and healing this be what pope francis be say in al god be not happy with situation that be objectively at variance with the command of the gospel god however be happy when people in such situation discern in conscience that he be ask they to make choice that

240,it be indeed war nato be at war with russia german jurist may say no but when the west arms ukraine when nato special force be in kyiv british sas and train their militia protege to use their weapon to kill russians do it really matter which shoulder fire the british make starstreak missile that shoot down russian helicopter anyway this war proxy war if you prefer be actually start in and escalate dramatically in when nato stop rely on national force ukrainian force who have prove somewhat inclined to defect with their weapon to russian speak militia to resort to internationalist and mercenary with the aggressive intention of weaken and drag russia into quagmire war be war and this war will escalate no one know the exact number of these far right militia set up by the west but reuters put the figure at one hundred thousand which jacque baud former senior nato adviser note and approve these paramilitary however play no role in normal field warfare but instead focus on maintain order strict adherence to the rule in the town they that be exactly what you get in mariupol and elsewhere these azov type militia be not deployed for field operation they be equip for urban warfare to be clear this ruthless idlib style mode of urban warfare be not about defeat the russian army but drag it into swelter envelop mud until february of this year this scheme be essentially intend to run as an attrition campaign an incipient quagmire but suddenly on february there be massive increase in artillery fire from the ukrainian side about time more than in the past accord to the osce and it coincide with biden's prediction of an invasion impend russian for the russians and for president putin in particular this be the sign of the beginning of the expect war of attrition and so on february russia's special military operation be launch why attrition why not an ordinary war well because nato do not want to put its boot on the ground she want low intensity insurgency why because it have be decide that the collapse of russia the ultimate goal must above all be obtain by an all out financial war thus avoid american loss thousand of sanction the seizure of russian foreign exchange reserve and concerted effort to sink the ruble in march biden be already boast in his state of the union address that the ruble have collapse by and the russian stock market by the government in ukraine be therefore treat as give the pain of the financial war more time to bite into russia but today we see that the calculus be change in fact it must change because the dynamic and delay be reverse first russia's economy do not collapse the ruble return to the level where it be before february then the west roll out its unprecedented anti putin psyop amid near daily allegation of atrocity and war crime attribute to russia the psyop war completely imbue the european public with passionate animosity and hatred for putin and the russian people his success in this regard be beyond doubt but there seem to have be less noticed anglo american sub plot as well this sub plot be to weaken germany and keep it from ally with russia for at least generation this last aspiration be well establish and have exist since before the first world war war be war and this war will escalate as ambrose evans pritchard write in the telegraph this week olaf scholz must choose between an energy embargo on russia and moral embargo on germany western europe's refusal to cut the financing of vladimir putin's war machine be unsustainable the moral and political damage for the eu become prohibitive but note the corollary to push for this eu energy embargo britain be up the ante by demand western response to the height of the existential threat face the european liberal order so here be the revised grand program russia survive the financial war because the eu continue to buy gas and energy from russia the eu and more specifically germany be finance the great war unprovoked otesque of putin say the meme not euro should reach putin be not this just an evolution of the west's goal in february no because the strategy of the boycott of russian energy do not consist in give the treasury war time to bear fruit but rather in draw the curtain on europe of course and on the germany in particular and soon europe have no mean of replace russian energy with other source in the year to come but european leader consume by frenzy of outrage at flood of image of atrocity emanate from ukraine and by sense that the liberal world must at all cost avoid loss in the ukraine conflict seem ready to go all the way the energy ban could happen quite quickly but here be the catch the united states see that its war of attrition be failure the ukrainian army be surround and will soon be eliminate one way or another thus the question be no long whether the war of attrition can give the sanction more time to bite on the russian population the treasury war also fail for complex reason relate to the fact that the bank of russia link the ruble to gold and the ruble to energy here again it be the economic financial consequence that change the situation inflation be skyrocket in europe and will rise far and public sentiment be change public support for sanction against russia be wane as the cost of live crisis begin to bite accord to poll the proportion of public opinion that would accept high fuel price as result of harsh western sanction against russia have fall point in one month from in march to this week deadline no long match euro sanction theoretically need more time to take effect however the west do not have the time it be inflation bite now and turn european sentiment against the ukrainian project the last thing the european establishment want be european spring as counterpoint to the arab spring the west face stark choice public support for the ukrainian project may be fade just as the reality on the ground show that the liberal european order be not will not be save from disintegration by ukraine yet public opinion have be make to believe that without victory for european ukraine without the total defeat and humiliation of russia the liberal world will not be able to survive thus we hear lip service from the eu high representative mr borrell that ukraine can only be resolve by military mean what he may be say be that the west need to be maximalist before inflation ruin the plan escalation or existential failurewar be war and this war will escalate,0

between an energy embargo on russia and moral embargo on germany western europe's refusal to cut the financing of vladimir putin's war machine be unsustainable the moral and political damage for the eu become prohibitive but note the corollary to push for this eu energy embargo britain be up the ante by demand western response to the height of the existential threat face the european liberal order so here be the revised grand program russia survive the financial war because the eu continue to buy gas and energy from russia the eu and more specifically germany be finance the great war unprovoked otesque of putin say the meme not euro should reach putin be not this just an evolution of the west's goal in february no because the strategy of the boycott of russian energy do not consist in give the treasury war time to bear fruit but rather in draw the curtain on europe of course and on the germany in particular and soon europe have no mean of replace russian energy with other source in the year to come but european leader consume by frenzy of outrage at flood of image of atrocity emanate from ukraine and by sense that the liberal world must at all cost avoid loss in the ukraine conflict seem ready to go all the way the energy ban could happen quite quickly but here be the catch the united states see that its war of attrition be failure the ukrainian army be surround and will soon be eliminate one way or another thus the question be no long whether the war of attrition can give the sanction more time to bite on the russian population the treasury war also fail for complex reason relate to the fact that the bank of russia link the ruble to gold and the ruble to energy here again it be the economic financial consequence that change the situation inflation be skyrocket in europe and will rise far and public sentiment be change public support for sanction against russia be wane as the cost of live crisis begin to bite accord to poll the proportion of public opinion that would accept high fuel price as result of harsh western sanction against russia have fall point in one month from in march to this week deadline no long match euro sanction theoretically need more time to take effect however the west do not have the time it be inflation bite now and turn european sentiment against the ukrainian project the last thing the european establishment want be european spring as counterpoint to the arab spring the west face stark choice public support for the ukrainian project may be fade just as the reality on the ground show that the liberal european order be not will not be save from disintegration by ukraine yet public opinion have be make to believe that without victory for european ukraine without the total defeat and humiliation of russia the liberal world will not be able to survive thus we hear lip service from the eu high representative mr borrell that ukraine can only be resolve by military mean what he may be say be that the west need to be maximalist before inflation ruin the plan escalation or existential failurewar be war and this war will escalate,0

254,to say that the news be messy today would be the height of an understatement every day newspaper headline present we with new set of conflict datum that convince we of lie that serve someone's interest no matter how hard we try to keep up with the situation weed out the redundant stuff to find the useful information amid the din be full time job sometimes though it be good to take few step back get back to the basic and remember who the player be what they want and then ask each of they the big question do they succeed but in order to be able to ask this question we must honestly ask ourselves the follow question what will they be willing to do to survive in the current events this be the most uncomfortable question you can ask someone what would you do to survive to protect your family your position the idea you have of yourself everyone have limit to their morality everyone everyone have shadow dark side place where they withdraw into their hobbesian self and see the world only in term of war of all against all anyone who refuse to admit it be someone you should scream away from those who always claim moral superiority who be always the good one be those who have no limit to their behavior as the great mencken proclaim almost year ago the urge to save humanity be almost always pretense the real urge be to lead power be what all messiah really seek not the ability to serve this be true even for godly brother who take the gospel to foreign land it be in this context that we must ask this question what will they do of course the answer be anything they need this be why never discard anything in my analysis that be why always ready to skip five or six step before the big move because that be the limit of the behavior of the group study today it may be davo tomorrow the fed the next day russia they all have preferred end state solution to their personal equation with their own combination of input variable see it as set of differential equation will solve we all want they to boil down to set of outcome that will get someone close to their preferred outcome and the scary part for all of we should be realize that not only be there not single thought where everyone's outcome be maximize there be not even win lose condition there be only loser we because the first rule of any organization be self survival throw mission statement corporate speech and hr virtue signal in the dumpster and set it on fire at the end of the day all that matter be survival only when this be nearly assure can an organization begin to think beyond its repti ##lian brain like you and and at this point all the major faction have be reduce to this their horizon be just out of reach and they be strive to reach it because it be there ready but like zeno's paradox they never reach it because it be never possible to reach it in the first place what fear more than anything what see in too many people who analyze the relationship between geopolitic market and ideology be complacency there be surprising amount of normalcy bias in the analyst caste too many calm head will prevail and not enough they all have plan until they get punch in the face so when you think of davos and their state goal for the great reset and rescue the world from climate change do you really think there be limit to their behavior do you really believe that they will not start nuclear war that they will not unleash virulent plague that they will not create cure bad than the disease that they will not cause false flag shooting in school or that they will not release supreme court opinion when you think of the federal reserve in the context of an unprecedented assault on its autonomy and the commercial banking interest whose protection be its raison d'etre do you really think that today at this point would not it cause an economic collapse to save itself from another group say davos that would threaten all of this with destruction so all those who pontificate on the fait that the fed will only make one or two rate hike because that be what the model be say because that be what the fed's past behavior be suppose to tell they what will you tell your customer when the fed make fourth hike of basis point or that it will accelerate the pace of quantitative tightening to billion month and allow the us year bond to hit be you go to shrug your shoulder and say um sorry it be my fault face with the prospect of nuclear rearm ukraine ally with neoconservative ideologue in congress and the us state department commit to singular vision of hegemony over the planet

corrupt morally immoral congressional leader on capitol hill who have enrich themselves personally and have weave huge web of bullshit so vast and cumbersome that we can barely follow the detail even surface would not they do anything to prevent their evil from come to light and be plausibly debunk know that denial be the only thing that matter in today newly confirm fomc chairman jerome powell be summon by president biden to the white house to discuss the economy biden and the democrats be scared to death this fall biden obviously want powell to stop raise rate democrat only want to lose house seat in november that be all the election fraud infrastructure be pay for with george soros money powell have barely start the tightening cycle and these people shamelessly after delay his confirmation for year after abuse their power over the fed summon powell like dog to the white house and tell he do not hurt our chance this fall if be powell would smile like the cheshire cat before disappear into the bowel of the marriner eccle building and consider basis point hike just for fun or he might see his shadow get scared and make deal but at this point with whom with whom do we make an agreement bondholder davo biden with whom seriously be this what our politic be reduce to by these venal moron control by davos be there still people out there who be think bit it be be year since ve be tell you that no one be ask the right question about what the fed be prepared to do not just to save itself but possibly with the much large goal of break people who intentionally break the world for their benefit too many people fail to exceed budget or tax revenue figure bond market the action the fed could not burn it all down could it those who do not want to ask this question seriously be those who keep look away from the abyss because the abyss look back at they they refuse to consider what happen when the game board be so turn upside down when jenga's tower be so fragile that the only win move be to flick the table and watch it all crumble the fed have look into this chasm in the past and always walk away from it but that be when there be still time but the davos have push we to the brink of societal collapse across the west it have refuse to even consider that it be the abyss and because of this the fed may be face with the heroic choice to jump and let we pick up

255,to say that the news be messy today would be the height of an understatement every day newspaper headline present we with new set of conflict datum that convince we of lie that serve someone's interest no matter how hard we try to keep up with the situation weed out the redundant stuff to find the useful information amid the din be full time job sometimes though it be good to take few step back get back to the basic and remember who the player be what they want and then ask each of they the big question do they succeed but in order to be able to ask this question we must honestly ask ourselves the follow question what will they be willing to do to survive in the current circumstance this be the most uncomfortable question you can ask someone what would you do to survive to protect your family your position an idea you have of yourself everyone have limit to their morality everyone everyone have shadow dark side place where they withdraw into their hobbesian self and see the world only in term of war of all against all anyone who refuse to admit it be someone there should scream away from those who always claim moral superiority who be always the good one be those who have no limit to their behavior as the great mencken proclaim almost year ago the urge to save humanity be almost always pretense the real urge be to lead power be what all messiah really seek not the ability to serve this be true even for godly brother who take the gospel to foreign land it be in this context that we must ask this question what will they do of course the will be anything they need this be why never discard anything in my analysis that be why always ready to skip five or six step before the big move because that be the limit of the behavior of the group study today it may be davo tomorrow the fed the next day russia they all have preferred end state solution to their personal equation with their own combination of input variable see it as set of differential equation to solve we all want they to boil down to set of outcome that will get someone close to their preferred outcome and the scary part for all of we should be realize that not only be there not single combination where everyone's outcome be maximize there be not even win lose condition there be only loser we because the first rule of any organization be self survival throw mission statement corporate speech and hr virtue signal in the dumpster and set it on fire at the end of the day all that matter be survival only when this be nearly assure can an organization begin to think beyond its repti ##lian brain like you and and at this point all the major faction have be reduce to this their horizon be just out of reach and they be strive to reach it because it be there ready but like zeno's paradox they never reach it because it be never possible to reach it in the first place what fear more than anything what see in too many people who analyze the relationship between geopolitic market and ideology be complacency there be surprising amount of normalcy bias in the analyst caste too many calm head will prevail and not enough they all have plan until they get punch in the face so when you think of davos and their state goal for the great reset and rescue the world from climate change do you really think there be limit to their behavior do you really believe that they will

262,an article from conflict the supreme court of the united states end the bureaucracy that intend to control the life of americans it would be urgent to protect the life of european citizen against the useless and liberticidal bureaucracy of brussels strasbourg in the space of fortnight the united states supreme court render historic decision in june that will have significant consequence for decade she come she begin by reaffirm that the right to bear arm be constitutional right that sport teacher have the right to pray silently on sport field and then in the dobbs case the court decide that the american constitution do not take side on the issue of abortion and that therefore the federal state do not have to deal with it and that it be up to the people and to elect representative to decide see the article very comprehensive by drieu godefridi these decision shock the politically correct world of europe which immediately criticize these decision without even bother to read the legal text president macron and other have even take the liberty of criticize decision by constitutional court in third state to conclude the series of decision from its june session the us supreme court conclude that limit co emission from power plant should be decide by lawmaker and not by official of the environmental protection agency epa snub for joe biden aka barack obama like the dobbs decision west virginia epa be leak to the press on june which be very unusual to try if possible to modify the vote before it become final an administrative investigation be underway unable to legislate on the decarbonization of power plant because america and therefore also the legislature be divide president barack obama have authorize the federal agency to enact law against coal plant the justice rule six to three that the epa have no right to take legislative power just as they do not speak out on the merit of abortion they do not speak out on the climate but hint that the obama biden duo must go through congressional decision if it want to limit co emission the court consider that congress can not abdicate delegate its responsibility on major issue that affect the life of american citizen such as co emission since major policy must be approve by representative the administration attempt to legally impose its policy on capitol hill this decision have provoke many reaction and activist on both side of the atlantic be not let it go nathaniel keohane president of the center for climate and energy solution manipulate information like all activist do say the decision threaten to relegate the united states far behind our international partner who be accelerate their effort to meet their climate commitment we will see at the end of this article that if there be any acceleration it concern global co emission the wall street journal write that the three dissent justice lament that congress lack the expertise to regulate technical matter such as climate change in footnote justice gorsuch note the evil sic character of woodrow wilson progressive critic of the constitution and founder of the administrative state as believe in government by expert because the people be stupid the real problem for dissenter be that the constitution deliberately make it difficult to pass law it could be argue that in the eu it be the legislator who decide on these very complex issue but it must also be recognize that the european legislator have create chaos as we will see later the lawsuit be launch at the request of the state of west virginia which have lead coalition of other republican state and coal company to challenge environmental official abuse of power which force coal and gas producer to subsidize renewable energy ministry or agency deal with the environment be environmental stronghold that be there to advocate for the cause have experience this in my professional life read the excellent analysis by philippe silberzahn when expert become activist environmental activist expert on june the european court of auditor publish report show that the european commission spend around one billion euro per year on external consultant between and the period during which the fit decarbonization policy be design regard thee use of external consultant the court of auditor note that the use of these service nevertheless have significant shortcoming which create risk of excessive dependence and conflict of interest the commission do not sufficiently manage these risk and provide only limited information on the use of consultant oh sure not all of these consultant be necessarily environmentalist but if they dared not dance like the politically correct whistle they just would not get any more contract in the past it be the service of the european commission that control the expertise the kinock reform around remove technical skill from service and since then expertise have be provide by consultant and lobby the phenomenon be sublimate within the european parliament this result in increasingly complex decision which as we get into technical issue be not necessarily rational or balance the directive amend the energy efficiency directive contain page of small print change to the directive which have page annexe and even complicated mathematical formula so difficult to write in text so there be currently page of legislation in the official journal of the eu to explain how to do energy efficiency it be urgent and essential to return to pragmatic realism because the scale and the bureaucratic cost of our effort to reduce emission be increasingly detrimental to we in the field of decarbonization you will have notice that we talk less and less about sustainable development it be the environmental ngo that be the most influential just look at the implausible decision to ban thermal vehicle by while it be believe that the car manufacturer lobby be all powerful it be in fact the green lobby that have impose their will in the sector where europe be the leader this failure be such that the stellantis group car brand decide to leave the acea lobby unable to defend its survival we will not dwell on the thorny question of subsidy in strasbourg and brussels where thousand of green lobbyist be pay through project control carbon be control life what should we conclude we have enter an extremely complex world that can no long be master as the implication be many and varied with equally complex time scale and feedback loop take the example of renewable energy at first glance brilliant and common sense idea but after year of technological promotion and year of market manipulation we be face an energy crisis that be hit citizen and industry hard german wind turbine will not be able to do anything to save the german chemical industry if vladimir putin decide to stop supply germany with the natural gas that the factory sorely need to operate it be urgent to stop this mad race which lead to disenchantment of the citizen for what have allow we to live year of peace instead of peace we now have fear poverty and lack of freedom since as climatologist richard lindzen say if you control carbon you control life if the citizen do not react not only will the eu control every detail of our life but it will sink we even far in precariousness the rest of the world not bother with co emission datum from bp's statistical annual review release this week show global co emission have increase by since the base year eu emission have fall by and non oecd emission have increase by our bureaucracy will never succeed in reduce global co emission coal consumption in china and india account for two third of global consumption the state of west virginia will continue thank to the united states supreme court to burn coal like the rest of the world just like we if vladimir putin take revenge on european sanction against russia by cut off the gas russianend of green bureaucracy in the

that the american constitution do not take side on the issue of abortion and that therefore the federal state do not have to deal with it and that it be up to the people and their elect representative to decide see the article very comprehensive by drieu godefridi these decision shock the politically correct world of europe which immediately criticize these decision without even bother to read the legal text president macron and other have even take the liberty of criticize decision by sovereign court in third state to conclude the series of decision from its june session the us supreme court conclude that limit co emission from power plant should be decide by lawmaker and not by official of the environmental protection agency epa snub for joe biden aka barack obama like the dobbs decision west virginia epa be leak to the press on june which be very unusual to try if possible to modify the vote should it become final an administrative investigation be underway unable to legislate on the decarbonization of power plant because america and therefore also the legislature be divide president barack obama have authorize the federal agency to enact law against coal plant the justice rule six to three that the epa have no right to take legislative power just as they do not speak out on the merit of abortion they do not speak out on the climate but hint that the obama biden duo must go through congressional decision will it want to limit co emission the court consider that congress can not abdicate delegate its responsibility on major issue that affect the life of american citizen is as co emission since major policy must be approve by representative the administration attempt to legally impose its policy on capitol hill this decision have provoke many reaction and activist on both side of the atlantic be not let it go nathaniel keohane president of the center for climate and energy solution manipulate information like all activist do say the decision threaten to relegate the united states far behind our international partner who be accelerate their effort to meet their climate commitment we will see at the end of this article that if there be any acceleration it concern global co emission the wall street journal write that the three dissent justice lament that congress lack the expertise to regulate technical matter such as climate change in footnote justice gorsuch note the evil sic character of woodrow wilson progressive critic of the constitution and founder of the administrative state as believe in government by expert because the people be stupid the real problem for dissenter be that the constitution deliberately make it difficult to pass law it could be argue that in the eu it be the legislator who decide on these very complex issue but it must also be recognize that the european legislator have create chaos as we will see later the lawsuit be launch at the request of the state of west virginia which have lead coalition of other republican state and coal company to challenge environmental official abuse of power which force coal and gas producer to subsidize renewable energy ministry or agency deal with the environment be environmental stronghold that be there to advocate for the cause have experience this in my professional life read the excellent analysis by philippe silberzahn when expert become activist environmental activist expert on june the european court of auditor publish report show that the european commission spend around one billion euro per year on external consultant between and the period during which the fit decarbonization policy be design regard thee use of external consultant the court of auditor note that the use of these service nevertheless have significant shortcoming which create risk of excessive dependence and conflict of interest the commission do not sufficiently manage these risk and provide only limited information on the use of consultant oh sure not all of these consultant be necessarily environmentalist but if they dared not dance like the politically correct whistle they just would not get any more contract in the past it be the service of the european commission that control the expertise the kinock reform around remove technical skill from service and since then expertise have be provide by consultant and lobby the phenomenon be sublimate within the european parliament this result in increasingly complex decision which as we get into technical issue be not necessarily rational or balance the directive amend the energy efficiency directive contain page of small print change to the directive which have page annexe and even complicated mathematical formula so difficult to write in text so there be currently page of legislation in the official journal of the eu to explain how to do energy efficiency it be urgent and essential to return to pragmatic realism because the scale and the bureaucratic cost of our effort to reduce emission be increasingly detrimental to we in the field of decarbonization you will have notice that we talk less and less about sustainable development it be the environmental ngo that be the most influential just look at the implausible decision to ban thermal vehicle by while it be believe that the car manufacturer lobby be all powerful it be in fact the green lobby that have impose their will in the sector where europe be the leader this failure be such that the stellantis group car brand decide to leave the acea lobby unable to defend its survival we will not dwell on the thorny question of subsidy in strasbourg and brussels where thousand of green lobbyist be pay through project control carbon be control life what should we conclude we have enter an extremely complex world that can no long be master as the implication be many and varied with equally complex time scale and feedback loop take the example of renewable energy at first glance brilliant and common sense idea but after year of technological promotion and year of market manipulation we be face an energy crisis that be hit citizen and industry hard german wind turbine will not be able to do anything to save the german chemical industry if vladimir putin decide to stop supply germany with the natural gas that the factory sorely need to operate it be urgent to stop this mad race which lead to disenchantment of the citizen for what have allow we to live year of peace instead of peace we now have fear poverty and lack of freedom since as climatologist richard lindzen say if you control carbon you control life if the citizen do not react not only will the eu control every detail of our life but it will sink we even far in precariousness the rest of the world not bother with co emission datum from bp's statistical annual review release this week show global co emission have increase by since the base year eu emission have fall by and non oecd emission have increase by our bureaucracy will never succeed in reduce global co emission coal consumption in china and india account for two third of global consumption the state of west virginia will continue thank to the united states supreme court to burn coal like the rest of the world just like we if vladimir putin take revenge on european sanction against russia by cut off the gas russianend of green bureaucracy in the us but not in the

whether the jet stream have change and the weather pattern be therefore last long the mere fact that it have become warm automatically mean that the probability of extreme precipitation increase we the climate scientist at the geomar helmholtz center for ocean research in kiel mojib latif conversely the great evaporation also lead to more drought those be two side of the same coin say the

in western europe explain rousi the form of the azore high have also change since the beginning of industrialization in recent study in nature geoscience we scientist be able to use simulation to show

currently under water in some area it be the fourth flood this year over, people have to be evacuate and many area of the city be without electricity due to storm ship get into distress off the coast but it can not be tow into port or evacuate at the moment for this reason the portland bay be tow far out to sea however the reason for the flooding be not the storm but heavy rain because warm air can hold more water such event be increase in many country around the world due to global warming in february march and april severe flooding have already occur in eastern australia where sydney be also locate at that time more than people die and there be insure damage of. billion euro estimate the australian industry association for insurance company the insurance council of australia this make the flood the costly in australia's history at least from an insurance perspective but they probably will not stay that way for long management consultancy deloitte estimate that the economic cost of natural disaster in australia will increase significantly from. billion euro per year to. billion euro in that would almost double in year eastern australia will be particularly affect the deloitte report estimate that two third of the damage will occur in this part of the country this be partly because the big city like sydney melbourne brisbane and canberra be locate there and partly because of climate change not only heavy rain event continue to increase but also tropical cyclone because of the warm sea water these be get far and far south where the big city be australia's new

the glacier to shrink and possibly break off like at the foot of mount marmolada the demolition be precede by long lasting heat wave in italy at the altitude of the marmolada glaci the temperature be around ten degree celsius usually they hardly exceed the freezing point together with little snowfall in winter this favor the disaster between the th and early st century temperature in the alp rise

atlantic rainforest rampant urban sprawl and land depletionlung be the main cause but climate change be also partly to blame this be the conclusion reach by research team from the world weather attribution initiative which take close look at the catastrophe without human cause global warming rainfall in the northeast would have be about fifth less intense the researcher say they assume that extreme heavy rain event will become more frequent and more violent in the region in the brazilian amazon region climate researcher have find that the atmosphere over the rainforest have become dry over the past year make drought more likely on the one hand the cause be the progressive deforestation and slash and burn for the expansion of cattle pasture and soybean field but global warming be

the entire flood area which also affect belgium and the netherland in addition to the federal state of north rhine westphalia and rhineland palatinate scientist be quickly able to explain to what

service dwd assume temperature increase of. degree in germany between the year and this mean that the proportion of water vapor have increase by. percent over this period more water vapor mean more rain incidentally so be the risk of thunderstorm second factor the jet stream be decrease and move north the band of strong wind be slow because the temperature differential between the tropic and polar region that otherwise drive it have decrease instead of continuous wind the jet stream today often run in wave this increasingly lead to very slow move or even stand bet event this combination enable extreme rainfall in the flood region more than liter per square meter be measure within hour unusual amount of rain and the narrow development of the valley ultimately lead to the disaster on

514,spring should bring breath of fresh air but read the newspaper these day it be disconcert to read how after year of austerity and misery and despite pandemic and war the guardian of orthodoxy continue to offer we the usual recipe on may the european commission publish the country report the report with which the commission express the result of its monitoring of the economic and social condition of the member state express series of recommendation with which the process of surveillance of the budget policy but not only of the state surveillance which as part of the post pandemic recovery plan be closely link to the disbursement of fund from the next generation eu program and therefore to the pnrr in fact as ursula von der leyen president of the european commission recall with reference to the specific recommendation for each country until now it depend only on the country to respect they or not but now the recommendation be link to subsidy and potential loan obviously there there also some for italy and read it make one's arm drop already on the front page the report tell we who we be and where we come from and perhaps that be the only thing we have to thank he for because with simple graph he remind we erase the unbearable rhetoric of the various good who have follow that since the financial crisis of not only have the gap with the other european economy dramatically increase but even the pandemic have catch italy with real gdp still low than the pre level the rest be recent history the most significant fall in gdp in europe during rebound which unlike what happen in other country be largely insufficient to recover the lost ground the gdp line which with the war return to become horizontal and at level that there always low than in in short year in which we have lose ground not only in relative sense but also in an absolute sense what the report incidentally forget to mention be that in these fifteen year and in particular from until the beginning of the pandemic we have be among the most diligent student in carry out homework read apply austerity measure with continuous primary surplus and eliminate what little social measure remained faithfully applying the advice that we find in the report of previous year in short reading that to be honest be equivalent to rejection of the master and not of the pupil but anyhow the report dedicate to italy cheerfully shrug and propose the usual recipe make up of cut reform and the only novelty wait for the pnrr continue with the description of the exist situation the drafter of the report regret that also due to the non temporary measure adopt in the last two year the public deficit will continue to exceed the magical threshold of regret the good time for they of the when we have reduce it to. also thank to an impressive series of primary surplus yet today we know well what this mean during the pandemic for example in term of lack of service hospital staff bed or chicken coop class and dilapidate structure just to mention two of the most affected sector we continue with the inevitable excessive macroeconomic imbalance imbalance which translate in the language of the commission as excessive public debt public debt to be cut indiscriminately especially through the reduction of public spending thus go to aggravate the already dramatic situation of public service in italy and unemployment the latter be obviously an imbalance that the commission can tolerate furthermore the structural weakness of the labor market be mention even if the commission must also recognize that the partial recovery in the level of employment after the pandemic be essentially due to precarious work last but not least the report remind we that italy be among the european country most dependent on russian gas and that therefore it will probably suffer the most from the economic repercussion of the war if this be the state of the art the outlook on the future be if possible even more depressing give the need to resume the march towards balanced budget and with all due respect to those who rejoice at the suspension of the stability pact after all if we be the good we self inflict austerity all hope seem to be place in the salvific property of the pnrr with respect to which it should be remember that italy be the large beneficiary in absolute term and one of the only four country to have also request access to loan put aside that as we have already explain elsewhere this intervention be largely insufficient when not openly contradictory whatwhat really impress be see the various reform associate with the pnrr line up cut bureaucracy to heal public administration that be insufficiently responsive to the need of business sic reform of the public sector and the example give be that of temporary expert hire precisely for the management of the pnrr liberalization in particular for public service see local transport water garbage etc in short all stuff already see and hear and unfortunately often already apply to the point that we know all too well the harmful effect on our quality of life for the rest little else include tax system to be reform by shift the weight more to taxis on consumption and particularly low rate be target the tool to try to mitigate the effect of structurally regressive tax and on real estate include first home however the european commission be in good indeed bad company the annual surveillance mission to italy of the international monetary fund end on may and even in this case before leave the expert think it appropriate to leave we few advice in addition to call for broken record credible two pronged strategy to significantly reduce the high deficit and debt over the medium term this report focus more on the economic consequence of the war by make it clear that the fiscal response to the energy shock should be more contained than what happen for the pandemic the solution in this case be identify in the repower eu plan therefore practically nothing and on social bonus see the recent and largely insufficient aid decree also in this case the most interesting thing lie in what the report do not say in the presence of crazy bill go ahead and give few coin to those more on the ground but woe to request more profound and structural intervention by the state in regulate the market even timid intervention on some bill item such as excise duty and system charge be discourage because although this immediately reduce price for family and business energy efficiency be discourage and the advantage be for the benefit of all consumer in conclusion the european commission and the international monetary fund be call for order effectively propose the same recipe thank to which we be find without tool in the face of the disaster of the pandemic we know that the improvement of our quality of life pass through an exactly opposite path relaunching of social spending by the state and local authority which also mean current spending for example to pay doctor nurse teacher etc political coherent environmental and energy policy stable employment contract and decent wage truly progressive tax system today as never before to achieve these goal we need to free ourselves from the bad advice and adviser of the past even in the form self impose by our local politicthe advice of the eu commission and the imf the troika threaten italy again,0

because with simple graph he remind we erase the unbearable rhetoric of the various good who have follow that since the financial crisis of not only have the gap with the other european economy dramatically increase but even the pandemic have catch italy with real gdp still low than the pre level the rest be recent history the most significant fall in gdp in europe have rebound which unlike what happen in other country be largely insufficient to recover the lost ground the gdp line which with the war return to become horizontal and at level that be always low than in in short year in which we have lose ground not only in relative sense but also in an absolute sense use the report incidentally forget to mention be that in these fifteen year and in particular from until the beginning of the pandemic we have be among the most diligent people in carry out homework read apply austerity measure with continuous primary surplus and eliminate what little social measure remained faithfully apply the advice that we find in the report of previous year in short reading that to be honest be equivalent to rejection of the master and not of the pupil but anyhow the report dedicate to italy cheerfully shrug and propose the usual recipe make up of cut reform and the only novelty wait for the pnrr continue with the description of the exist situation the drafter of the report regret that also due to the non temporary measure adopt in the last two year the public deficit will continue to exceed the magical threshold of regret the good time for they of the when we have reduce it to. also thank to an impressive series of primary surplus yet today we know well what this mean during the pandemic for example in term of lack of service hospital staff bed or chicken coop class and dilapidate structure just to mention two of the most affected sector we continue with the inevitable excessive macroeconomic imbalance imbalance which translate in the language of the commission as excessive public debt public debt to be cut indiscriminately especially through the reduction of public spending thus go to aggravate the already dramatic situation of public service in italy and unemployment the latter be obviously an imbalance that the commission can tolerate furthermore the structural weakness of the labor market be mention even if the commission must also recognize that the partial recovery in the level of employment after the pandemic be essentially due to precarious work last but not least the report remind we that italy be among the european country most dependent on russian gas and that therefore it will probably suffer the most from the economic repercussion of the war if this be the state of the art the outlook on the future be if possible even more depressing give the need to resume the march towards balanced budget and with all due respect to those who rejoice at the suspension of the stability pact after all if we be the good we self inflict austerity all hope seem to be place in the salvific property of the pnrr with respect to which it should be remember that italy be the large beneficiary in absolute term and one of the only four country to have also request access to loan put aside that as we have already explain elsewhere this intervention be largely insufficient when not openly contradictory whatwhat really impress be see the various reform associate with the pnrr line up cut bureaucracy to heal public administration that be insufficiently responsive to the need of business sic reform of the public sector and the example give be that of temporary expert hire precisely for the management of the pnrr liberalization in particular for public service see local transport water garbage etc in short all stuff already see and hear and unfortunately often already apply to the point that we know all too well the harmful effect on our quality of life for the rest little else include tax system to be reform by shift the weight more to taxis on consumption and particularly low rate be target the tool to try to mitigate the effect of structurally regressive tax and on real estate include first home however the european commission be in good indeed bad company the annual surveillance mission to italy of the international monetary fund end on may and even in this case before leave the expert think it appropriate to leave we few advice in addition to call for broken record credible two pronged strategy to significantly reduce the high deficit and debt over the medium term this report focus more on the economic consequence of the war by make it clear that the fiscal response to the energy shock should be more contained than what happen for the pandemic the solution in this case be identify in the repower eu plan therefore practically nothing and on social bonus see the recent and largely insufficient aid decree also in this case the most interesting thing lie in what the report do not say in the presence of crazy bill go ahead and give few coin to those more on the ground but woe to request more profound and structural intervention by the state in regulate the market even timid intervention on some bill item such as excise duty and system charge be discourage because although this immediately reduce price for family and business energy efficiency be discourage and the advantage be for the benefit of all consumer in conclusion the european commission and the international monetary fund be call for order effectively propose the same recipe thank to which we be find without tool in the face of the disaster of the pandemic we know that the improvement of our quality of life pass through an exactly opposite path relaunching of social spending by the state and local authority which also mean current spending for example to pay doctor nurse teacher etc political coherent environmental and energy policy stable employment contract and decent wage truly progressive tax system today as never before to achieve these goal we need to free ourselves from the bad advice and adviser of the past even in the form self impose by our local politicthe advice of the eu commission and the imf the troika threaten italy again,0

and then there be the other league that of the territory which every day have to face the bulletin of hospitalization due to the virus the one of those who have see many of their fellow citizen die from the first wave of covid and have no problem come to confrontation even with their own party mate and that of those who know how much the virus can hurt and for this reason try to convert the no vax just broaden your gaze little go beyond the council of minister and salvini's statement to see that this second league be gain more and more ground and even if no one openly expose himself he look at salvini's line with some annoyance too wavering and ambiguous accord to those who have understand that covid must be fight primarily by protect as many people as possible in the front row among the northern league supporter in favor of the vaccine be roberto calderoli the vice president of the senate tell corriere today that he spend the christmas holiday between the fear of be infect and an attempt to convert non vax relative five time out of seven he succeed those who persist in not acknowledge reality a say would force he merely see what happen in the hospital ward his line be very clear which certainly clash with that of those who with his own card in his wallet be instead ambiguous or even oppose to the vaccine and the green pass the most recent example on this front concern two brother from sassuolo both councilor both northern league supporter they have decide to resign because they be against the vaccine and therefore without super green pass the choice do not move calderoli one millimeter who reply the world will go on anyway we will find two more responsible councilor to find northern league supporter who have repeatedly expose themselves in favor of vaccine even at the cost of end up in the crosshair of no vax just look at the region massimiliano fedriga and luca zaia both lead member of the carroccio be at the forefront of the vaccination campaign have an obligation to tell the truth to citizen do not have it with no vax but get vaccinate be the solution we can not continue to spread the alibi that this virus be cure at home that be enough be treat at home but without pneumology and intensive care many would have die the president of the veneto region say in december and this be just one of his many utterance that have go in this direction massimiliano fedriga be no less the governor of friuli venezia giulia be among the first to invoke differentiated regime between vaccinate and non vaccinate in case the epidemiological situation worsen as indeed it be then his exposure cost he the threat of some no vax and the stash understand why those who administer the territory have very clear line in favor of the vaccine be quite simple if you listen to the word of pierpaolo roberti councilor for local autonomy and the public function of friuli venezia giulia in november he be the protagonist of question and answer on twitter with claudio borghi member of parliament of the league who be very critical of the rule on the green pass the reason for the clash be the increase in covid case in friuli venezia giulia due to the conjunction between no vax demonstration and the low percentage of immunize people return to that story roberti tell huffpost as from trieste can say that the difference in sensitivity on the subject be not only the prerogative of the league we who administer the territory however in addition to have privileged observatory have different role we be the one who see the bulletin of infection and hospitalization every day and the percentage of vaccinate if you touch thing firsthand if you see the number that be the sense of his reasoning one can only take one fact for grant the vaccine reduce serious case cut down on hospitalization and if someone be still skeptical on the subject roberti reply with the most recent datum right now in friuli venezia giulia we have people in intensive care thirty five be unvaccinate the commissioner have repeatedly expose himself on social medium against no vaxe and do not hide that he have receive more than few attack but do not even pay attention to it it be not even worth waste your time be minority very noisy but still minority in the same way he be convince that try to change the mind of the no vax hard core be now lose battle fight in the name of what be now an ideology the extension of the vaccination obligation which salvini do not like at all could ebe solution can not imagine real form of obligation conclude roberti and would like to remind you that the no vax have even accept to lose their job do not think they would stop in front of the obligation in the group of pro vax northern league supporter there be also the deputy from bergamo cristian invernizzi the protagonist of heavy bickering in the chamber with his colleague from the carroccio golinelli on the rule on the super green pass hear in the follow day he tone down the tone but reiterate he who have see many fellow citizen die and his father feel very ill due to the virus the importance of vaccine that there be double line and some annoyance for the position of the boss be now evident but those directly involve be careful not to make it manifest also because if you expose yourself too much you risk disciplinary proceeding within the party this could be the fate of giantonio da re veneto eurodeputy del carroccio on january in an interview with corriere launch very harsh attack on salvini the ambiguity of my party and my secretary be put at long time discomfort it have always be unjustifiable now it have become unsustainable he say and the thud of stone would have make less noise the next day alberto stefani commissioner of the venetian liga say he would like to bring da re's position before the regional executive da re have already be warn he say accord to what the via solferino newspaper report one do not go out in the newspaper argue against the federal secretariat everything suggest that all the other dissatisfied with salvini's line on vaccine will be careful not to use the same tone as the mep but the discontent be there it be enough to line up fact and word to understand that the opposite can not be saythere be pro vax league and that be what be win,0

enough be treat at home but without pneumology and intensive care many would have die the president of the veneto region say in december and this be just one of his many utterance that have go in this direction massimiliano fedriga be no less the governor of friuli venezia giulia be among the first to invoke differentiated regime between vaccinate and non vaccinate in case the epidemiological situation worsen as indeed it be then his exposure cost he the threat of some no vax and the stash understand why those who administer the territory have very clear line in favor of the vaccine be quite simple if you listen to the word of pierpaolo roberti councilor for local autonomy and the public function of friuli venezia giulia in november he be the protagonist of question and answer on twitter with claudio borghi member of parliament of the league who be very critical of the rule on the green pass the reason for the clash be the increase in covid case in friuli venezia giulia due to the conjunction between no vax demonstration and the low percentage of immunize people return to that story roberti tell huffpost as from trieste can say that the difference in sensitivity on the subject be not only the prerogative of the league we who administer the territory however in addition to have privileged observatory have different role we be the one who see the bulletin of infection and hospitalization every day and the percentage of vaccinate if you touch thing firsthand if you see the number that be the sense of his reasoning one can only take one fact for grant the vaccine reduce serious case cut down on hospitalization and if someone be still skeptical on the subject roberti reply with the most recent datum right now in friuli venezia giulia we have people in intensive care thirty five be unvaccinate the commissioner have repeatedly expose himself on social medium against no vaxe and do not hide that he have receive more than few attack but do not even pay attention to it it be not even worth waste your time be minority very noisy but still minority in the same way he be convince that try to change the mind of the no vax hard core be now lose battle fight in the name of what be now an ideology the extension of the vaccination obligation which salvini do not like at all could ebe solution can not imagine real form of obligation conclude roberti and would like to remind you that the no vax have even accept to lose their job do not think they would stop in front of the obligation in the group of pro vax northern league supporter there be also the deputy from bergamo cristian invernizzi the protagonist of heavy bickering in the chamber with his colleague from the carroccio golinelli on the rule on the super green pass hear in the follow day he tone down the tone but reiterate he who have see many fellow citizen die and his father feel very ill due to the virus the importance of vaccine that there be double line and some annoyance for the position of the boss be now evident but those directly involve be careful not to make it manifest also because if you expose yourself too much you risk disciplinary proceeding within the party this could be the fate of giantonio da re veneto eurodeputy del carroccio on january in an interview with corriere launch very harsh attack on salvini the ambiguity of my party and my secretary be put at long time discomfort it have always be unjustifiable now it have become unsustainable he say and the thud of stone would have make less noise the next day alberto stefani commissioner of the venetian liga say he would like to bring da re's position before the regional executive da re have already be warn he say accord to what the via solferino newspaper report one do not go out in the newspaper argue against the federal secretariat everything suggest that all the other dissatisfied with salvini's line on vaccine will be careful not to use the same tone as the mep but the discontent be there it be enough to line up fact and word to understand that the opposite can not be saythere be pro vax league and that be what be win,0

which of citizen be in favor of join the european union the high figure in the last year while be against sympathy for brussels have grow over time in only of icelander want to join while in the figure have grow to the acceleration in recent month be link to the ukrainian crisis and the search for great security with membership of the community bloc the same happen to finland and sweden which apply to join nato iceland be already part of the atlantic alliance and have follow parallel path the benefit of possible icelandic membership for brussels be not link to the energy sector that be to one of the most delicate issue in the ukrainian dossier reykjavik possess reserve of natural gas and oil and therefore could not increase a community reserve favor reduction of dependence on russia what make iceland strategic be its position crucial for control the sea route that guarantee access to the atlantic ocean and the north sea the friction between the west and russia have give new importance to that part of the world forget after the end of the cold war moscow intend to exploit it to expand the range of action of its naval and submarine fleet while the european union have lose ground after brexit furthermore relation between iceland and russia worsen after reykjavik's choice to join the european union's sanction against moscow iceland be deeply integrate with the union because it be part of the european economic area the schengen area participate without the right to participation in some program and agency and consult with the union on foreign policy matter frequently align with the position express by the latter in matter of international affair and take part in civilian peacekeeping mission that be establish in july after financial crisis and snap election iceland apply to become member of the european union for the market time the consultation have produce change in government with the alternation between the conservative of the independence party and the pro european of the social democratic alliance membership of the union be see as way to end the crisis by adopt the euro and as logical choice to have more decision make power in european politic the scenario however change rapidly iceland recover quickly from the crisis while the union sink into it also complicate bilateral relation the general election end with the victory of the progressive party which despite its name be center right political force and the independence party prime minister sigmundur davið gunnlaugsson say that the government would stop negotiation between iceland and the european union and that the latter would not resume until referendum be hold the progressive party be against the negotiation because it fear that union membership would undermine reykjavik's control of fish stock iceland have one of the most modern and productive fishing industry in the world and to maintain sustainable fish stock and protect the marine ecosystem annual quota be set which impose an upper limit on activity in this sector the ministry of fishery as recall by the bbc in be the most important department of the icelandic government and the then minister gunnar bragi sveinsson explain that he would never have choose to join the european union because in this way the iceland should not have share decision in the fishery sector with or other country make everything more complicated and give up the quota system not envisage by community policy in the application to join the european union be withdraw the consultation end with the election of parliament make up of two third by eurosceptic deputy and with the formation of grand coalition government lead by katrin jakobsdottir of the red green movement hostile towards the european union the executive be then reconfirm after the election in march of this year with the invasion of ukraine having begin few day ago fourteen deputy submit bill to parliament which provide for the summoning of kingnational referendum which should take place by the end of the year to ask the population whether iceland should restart accession negotiation with the european union prime minister jakobsdottir have show little enthusiasm for this development by declare that referendum can only take place when the majority of mp be in favor and that at the moment iceland should not force its hand to join the european union the problem also highlight by jakobsdottir be that the majority of parliament which have seat be not in favor of the referendum but only the social democrats the liberal party and the pirate party be the pirate party be an anti establishment movement form in in response to the collapse of the icelandic banking system after the financial crisis it be pro democracy populist political force with anarchist libertarian and anti copyright tendency direct great transparency by company and the nationalization of natural resource in some respect the program of this party recall that of the italian five star movement few year ago not the most trust group to make such relevant decisioneffect ukrainenow iceland be also tempt to join the eu,1

556,the conflict between russia and ukraine have lead to global food crisis at time of climate change pollution and other threat to the food supply in the near future food problem be likely to be global problem while conflict result from crop war will also become an international issue of major concern since darpa the united states advanced military research institute have be carry out defense program know as insect ally which it say be suppose to address potential risk associate with the food supply however in this program the pentagon use insect to insert genetically modify virus into the cellular dna of plant which could affect crop growth by alter the gene express by the plant themselves accord to medium report after the announcement the plan have receive widespread criticism from scientist and expert around the world who have warn that insect ally could open an easily weaponize technological pandora's box even the intention of the pentagon be not clear that it really about save humanity from hunger or on the contrary deliberately provoke humanitarian crisis to pursue some military purpose accord to expert interview by global time insect ally be turn this concern into real danger why do they use insect as vector why be the united states build biological laboratory near other country such as russia when pandora's box be open series of disaster will follow say be expert however this be just the tip of the iceberg of project that could easily turn into biological weapon in addition to the insect ally program the united states have conduct biological experiment around the world in its famous bio laboratory ignore safety and ethic principle and be in violation of the biological weapon convention insect become biological weapon the defense advanced research project agency darpa be research and development agency of the united states department of defense responsible for the development of high tech military application ever since darpa announce the insect ally program in the name of disaster prevention and increase agricultural productivity the controversy around the proposal have never cease accord to darpa's website the program pursue scalable readily implementable and generalizable countermeasure against potential natural and engineer threat to the food supply with the goal of preserve the agricultural system accord to darpa the program by apply targeted therapy seek to mitigate the impact of possible threat to the crop system include natural threat and those introduce by state or non state actor that could rapidly threaten national security accord to darpa the insect ally program study the possibility of modify the genetic heritage of plant through vector insect and the plant virus they transmit involve three technical area viral manipulation optimization of insect vector and selective gene therapy in plant ripe to achieve this goal the million project have fund at least four research institute as report by the medium in

forbe wonder zhang jie an expert at the plant protection institute of the chinese academy of agricultural science caas tell the global time that the possibility of use insect as vector of harmful bacteria and virus to attack crop and cause food crisis not only exist but also have large margin of development he say the three main crop rice wheat and maize all have lethal virus bacteria or fungus in fact target pest such as the rice leafhopper and wheat aphid can carry different virus to infect crop cause enormous damage it would be lethal to turn an insect into bioweapon because until now virus in crop have be very difficult to control once an infected crop develop symptom it be nearly impossible to save and the virus continue to vary make prevention even more difficult zhang say zhou huanbin colleague of zhang who study genome editing tell the global time that certain principle must be follow in crop gene edit one of which be to minimize the risk of uncontrolled spread of genetically modify crop also on the project's controllability gregory kaebnick an ethicist at the hastings center bioethic research institute in new york be quote by the ap as say that once introduce

weapon convention bwc because of the broad prohibition of the biological weapon convention any biological research of concern must be plausibly justify as be for peaceful purpose the insect ally program could be consider violation of the biological weapon convention if the reason present by darpa be implausible read the max planck institute article cornerstone of international biological weapon control the bwc be ready for signature in and go into effect in with over signatory state the united states first push for the cancellation of the bwc and later become the only country to oppose the establishment of multilateral verification mechanism for compliance with the convention use insect as vector to spread disease be classic biological weapon silja voeneky professor of international law at the university of freiburg in germany tell the washington post accord to voeneky the use of insect as key element in this program be particularly alarming because insect could be employ cheaply and surreptitiously by malicious actor his concern be echo by chinese military expert song zhongpe who call the insect ally technology typical form of biological weapon it could reduce crop yield in target country and artificially create food crisis in this way the affected country would lose its independence in the food sector and could become dependent on we food export even for genetically modify food which be part of biological warfare song say song believe that the united states should explain why insect should be use as vector in this research especially since insect could safely spread virus in other country crop it be not hard to see why the united states have set up biological lab near rival nation because only then can lab work with native specie he say for example it would be problematic if they bring american bug into ukrainian lab and then release they in russia long history of use insect vector the insect ally program be just one of many instance where us research have be accuse of cause dire consequence around the world especially through the use of biological laboratory the united states have openly admit to gexpand biological laboratory in country of the world of which in ukraine however the sign contract suggest that the united states have open laboratory in country far more than officially recognize one the pentagon have long history of use insect as disease vector accord to partially declassified report by the us military us biological warfare scientist have conduct several experiment on insect in the the us army's institute of medical research on infectious disease conduct experiment to test whether sand fly and mosquito could be vector of rift valley virus dengue chikungunya and eastern equine encephalitis accord to bulgarian investigative journalist dilyana gaytandzhieva the us military have be study their possible use as biological weapon in the same decade as part of us military operation call may day the aede aegupti mosquito be disperse in the state of georgia use terrestrial method mosquito be believe to be vector of dengue chikungunya and the zika virus gaytandzhieva also reveal that the pentagon would conduct entomological warfare test in country such as georgia and russia in the lugar center build in the united states near tbilisi the capital of georgia have be equip with an insect research facility and launch project call raise awareness about barcode of sand fly in georgia and caucasus in the follow year two other program have be start at the same centre as result since tbilisi have be infest with bite fly that have develop behavior atypical of local specie such as be able to survive all year round indoor and be highly resistant to cold biting fly have also be find in the neighboring dagestan region of russia furthermore while conduct research on deadly virus and bacteria the united states have be unable to ensure the safety of its biological laboratory the pentagon

international biological weapon control the bwc be ready for signature in and go into effect in with over signatory state the united states first push for the cancellation of the bwc and later become the only country to oppose the establishment of multilateral verification mechanism for compliance with the convention use insect as vector to spread disease be classic biological weapon silja voeneky professor of international law at the university of freiburg in germany tell the washington post accord to voeneky the use of insect as key element in this program be particularly alarming because insect could be employ cheaply and surreptitiously by malicious actor his concern be echo by chinese military expert song zhongpe who call the insect ally technology typical form of biological weapon it could reduce crop yield in target country and artificially create food crisis in this way the affected country would lose its independence in the food sector and could become dependent on we food export even for genetically modify food which be part of biological warfare song say song believe that the united states should explain why insect should be use as vector in this research especially since insect could safely spread virus in other country crop it be not hard to see why the united states have set up biological lab near rival nation because only then can lab work with native specie he say for example it would be problematic if they bring american bug into ukrainian lab and then release they in russia long history of use insect vector the insect ally program be just one of many instance where us research have be accuse of cause dire consequence around the world especially through the use of biological laboratory the united states have openly admit to gexpand biological laboratory in country of the world of which in ukraine however the sign contract suggest that the united states have open laboratory in country far more than officially recognize one the pentagon have long history of use insect as disease vector accord to partially declassified report by the us military us biological warfare scientist have conduct several experiment on insect in the the us army's institute of medical research on infectious disease conduct experiment to test whether sand fly and mosquito could be vector of rift valley virus dengue chikungunya and eastern equine encephalitis accord to bulgarian investigative journalist dilyana gaytandzhieva the us military have be study their possible use as biological weapon in the same decade as part of us military operation call may day the aede aegupti mosquito be disperse in the state of georgia use terrestrial method mosquito be believe to be vector of dengue chikungunya and the zika virus gaytandzhieva also reveal that the pentagon would conduct entomological warfare test in country such as georgia and russia in the lugar center build in the united states near tbilisi the capital of georgia have be equip with an insect research facility and launch project call raise awareness about barcode of sand fly in georgia and caucasus in the follow year two other program have be start at the same centre as result since tbilisi have be infest with bite fly that have develop behavior atypical of local specie such as be able to survive all year round indoor and be highly resistant to cold biting fly have also be find in the neighboring dagestan region of russia furthermore while conduct research on deadly virus and bacteria the united states have be unable to ensure the safety of its biological laboratory the pentagon admit in that in live anthrax sample have be mistakenly send from the military base at dugway prove ground near salt lake city utah to all state and nine country include the united kingdom

572,the vaccination campaign which have generate so much controversy have however increase the number of italian in favor of vaccination so much for no vax one might say the covid pandemic which have generate so many discussion around vaccine have instead increase the confidence of italian in this formidable mean of prevention and defense against disease this be irrefutable however one think about vaccine with the covid pandemic italians confidence in vaccination have increase more than out of citizen consider vaccine safe and effective tool among the hesitant out of be open to re evaluate their choice great dialogue with the doctor and the pharmacist clear and transparent information communication from the institution the increase in place of administration pharmacy workplace and school and incentive be the factor that emerge as decisive for increase the propensity to get vaccinate even among the hesitant this be what emerge from the survey conduct on sample of thousand citizen carry out by the european house ambrosetti and by the interdepartmental center for ethic and integrity in research of the national research council cnr in collaboration with swg present in rome during an event organize by the european house ambrosetti with the unconditional contribution of pfizer the survey therefore reveal that believe that vaccine be safe and effective health tool for combat infectious disease and that for of those interview the level of trust during the pandemic have increase especially in man in the region of the south and among generation positive signal also in view of the resumption of the anti covid vaccination campaign next autumn declare themselves in favor of the fourth dose of the anti covid vaccination next autumn and of those who do not he be still vaccinate and be open to do so the datum on flu vaccination be also encouraging with of subject who be vaccinate in the last season declare themselves in favor of repeat the administration it also emerge some of the interviewee feel informed about vaccine prefer their trust doctor the opinion of scientist and institutional website as source of information informal information channel such as friend and relative and social medium forum blog remain the source most use all those who be most skeptical of vaccination furthermore knowledge of mandatory vaccination be good understanding of the other recommend vaccine be poor of those interview say they be aware of the existence of mandatory vaccination in the pediatric age but only remember at least some of they value that decrease respectively and for recommend childhood vaccination in both case people with minor child and woman be among the well inform the law on the compulsory nature of vaccine for the age group and the numerous awareness raise initiative carry out have certainly contribute to increase the level of knowledge of pediatric vaccination with consequent coverage rate which although decrease during the pandemic stand at on value above the situation of adolescent and adult vaccination be different only declare having be vaccinate against papilloma virus in the age group only against pneumococcus in the age group only against herpe zoster in the age group the survey provide some important indication on the lever on which to act to improve citizen knowledge and consequently trust in vaccine prevention say daniela bianco partner and head of the healthcare area of the european house ambrosetti furthermore in of those hesitant and oppose to some vaccination such as the anti pneumococcal anti herpe zoster and anti papilloma virus vaccine declare themselves willing to learn more before be able to decide the need therefore emerge to increase effort in communication to increase the level of citizen knowledge also on these vaccination and again of the interviewee declare that they know people who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinate if hesitate or refuse to get vaccinate for all vaccine in general be only with reference to the anti covid vaccine the perceive obstacle to vaccination be essentially the fear of health risk and information gap incorrect or miss information even among subject who have declare that they do not consider vaccine safe and effective and those not vaccinate against covid the fear relate to safety be confirm as the main reason for non vaccination follow by doubt relate to the experiment among the instrumentsentitie which accord to the citizen themselves emerge from the survey can help increase the level of trust in vaccination programme include great dialogue with one's trust doctor or pharmacist great transparency of the institution of health and more frequent information campaign by health institution great dialogue and well information be also judge to be the most effective tool for change the mind of people who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinate also the increase in the point of administration of vaccination allow citizen to get close to vaccination prevention above all pharmacy but also place of study and work be the most appreciated one even among those who be less in favor of vaccine or have not be vaccinate against covid the

573,the vaccination campaign which have generate so much controversy have however increase on number of italian in favor of vaccination so much for no vax one might say the covid pandemic which have generate so many discussion around vaccine have instead increase the confidence of italian in this formidable mean of prevention and defense against disease this be irrefutable however one think about vaccine with the covid pandemic italians confidence in vaccination have increase more than out of citizen consider vaccine safe and effective tool among the hesitant out of be open to re evaluate their choice great dialogue with the doctor and the pharmacist clear and transparent information communication from the institution the increase in place of administration pharmacy workplace and school and incentive be the factor that emerge as decisive for increase the propensity to get vaccinate even among the hesitant this be what emerge from the survey conduct on sample of thousand citizen carry out by the european house ambrosetti and by the interdepartmental center for ethic and integrity in research of the national research council cnr in collaboration with swg present in rome during an event organize by the european house ambrosetti with the unconditional contribution of pfizer the survey therefore reveal that believe that vaccine be safe and effective health tool for combat infectious disease and that for of those interview the level of trust during the pandemic have increase especially in man in the region of the south and among generation positive signal also in view of the resumption of the anti covid vaccination campaign next autumn declare themselves in favor of the fourth dose of the anti covid vaccination next autumn and of those who do not he be still vaccinate and be open to do so the datum on flu vaccination be also encouraging with of subject who be vaccinate in the last season declare themselves in favor of repeat the administration it also emerge that of the interviewee feel informed about vaccine prefer their trust doctor the opinion of scientist and institutional website as source of information informal information channel such as friend and relative and social medium forum blog remain the source most use by those who be most skeptical of vaccination furthermore knowledge of mandatory vaccination be good knowledge of the other recommend vaccine be poor of those that say they be aware of the existence of mandatory vaccination in the last age but only remember at least some of they value that decrease respectively and for recommend childhood vaccination in both case people with minor child and woman be among the well inform the law on the compulsory nature of vaccine for the age group and the numerous awareness raise initiative carry out have certainly contribute to increase the level of knowledge of pediatric vaccination with consequent coverage rate which although decrease during the pandemic stand at on value above the situation of adolescent and adult vaccination be different only declare having be vaccinate against papilloma virus in the age group only against pneumococcus in the age group only against herpe zoster in the age group the survey provide some important indication on the lever on which to act to improve citizen knowledge and consequently trust in vaccine prevention say daniela bianco partner and head of the healthcare area of the european house ambrosetti furthermore in of those hesitant and oppose to some vaccination such as the anti pneumococcal anti herpe zoster and anti papilloma virus vaccine declare themselves willing to learn more before be able to decide the need therefore emerge to increase effort in communication to increase the level of citizen knowledge also on these vaccination and again of the interviewee declare that they know people who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinate if hesitate or refuse to get vaccinate for all vaccine in general be only with reference to the anti covid vaccine the perceive obstacle to vaccination be essentially the fear of health risk and information gap incorrect or miss information even among subject who have declare that they do not consider vaccine safe and effective and those not vaccinate against covid the fear relate to safety be confirm as the main reason for non vaccination follow by doubt relate to the experiment among the instrumentsentitie which accord to the citizen themselves emerge from the survey can help increase the level of trust in vaccination programme include great dialogue with one's trust doctor or pharmacist great transparency of the institution of health and more frequent information campaign by health institution great dialogue and well information be also judge to be the most effective tool for change the mind of people who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinate also the increase in the point of administration of vaccination allow citizen to get close to vaccination prevention above all pharmacy but also place of study and work be the most appreciated one even among those who be less in favor of vaccine or have not be vaccinate against covid the pharmacy be place deem appropriate for administer vaccine of those interview be also open to economic incentive primarily free check up and medical examination and bonus for gym and sport centre tool which in addition to increase the level of citizen trust also play role in activate economic activity say andrea grignolio head of the vaccine hesitancy forum of the interdepartmental center for ethic and integrity in

nail washington to its responsibility despite the fact that the western press continue to ignore the issue igor kirillov head of the russian federation's radioactive chemical and biological protection force recently reveal new information that seriously question the safety standard of ukrainian biolaboratorie accord to document in the possession of the russians the usa have allocate about million dollar to increase state level of security of the laboratory in merefa city in the kharkiv oblast however the ukrainian official reply that the modernization of the security system not be impossible until the facility be commission in violation of safety regulation and requirement this also mean that nobody know where the million disburse by the us authority have go kirillov also reveal that the search in ukraine be support not only by the united states but also by poland and germany however none of the country involve have have the foresight to notify the united nations of the existence by this joint project kirillov recall that each signatory to the biological and toxin weapon convention be require to submit an annual report to demonstrate the compliance of their research with the term

to report by the tass news agency this contradict the statement make by lewis gitter deputy political advisor to the us mission to the osce on may the russian official explain at the time gitter say aid have be send to kiev to reduce biological threat and support veterinary and public health to reduce the risk of disease outbreak and to secure illegal biological weapon leave in former soviet state after the fall of the ussr it beg the question why be the work under the joint military biological project codename up not mention in the report submit by the us and ukraine to the un this secrecy be reason to question the real goal of the pentagon in ukraine kirillov comment as we ourselves have already have the opportunity to underline in previous article ki ##rillov point out the existence of report from the ukrainian secret service about the activity of us biolaboratorie in ukraine which be consider as threat by the kiev intelligence itself in recent day an article by shan jie and fan wei publish in the chinese newspaper global time raise the question of the us program know as insect ally which could transform insect into lethal biological weapon the pentagon project involve transmit genetically modify virus to plant by alter crop gene officially the project would serve to avoid famine allow agriculture in unfavorable climate and defend plant from disease but in reality this project can be use as weapon obtain exactly the opposite effect namely that of destroy foodstuff of the enemy or to spread deadly disease among the population why do they use insect as vector why be the us build bio lab near other country like russia when pandora's box be open series of disaster will follow say an expert interview by the global time however this project represent only the tip of the iceberg of the many covert operation conduct by the united states around the planet in addition to the insect ally program the united states have conduct biological experiment all

protection of the human fetus and the condition for the admissibility of abortion and the european convention for the protection of human right and fundamental freedom which have be part of the polish legal order since 1993 there be three case complaint by alicja tysiac complaint by and the complaint of and all result in judgment in which the tribunal rule that the polish authority have violate the european convention for the protection of human right and fundamental freedom in relation to the woman complainant the right to respect for private life be violate and in the case of also the prohibition of inhuman treatment for the purpose of these case have cut my professional tooth on study the consequence of ban or restrict access to legal abortion for human right in the dimension of national organization in the perspective of comparative law and international law that be why it be with some irritation that read some legal enunciation about abortion today because of the carelessness of the author the superficiality of their text or the hard ideologization of the subject resistant to the rule of the legal craft and often also to fact an example from the last few day an interview with my talented colleague attorney tomasz snarski publish by the catholic information agency understand that kai need expert legitimacy for the content it publish on the legal aspect of abortion however have serious problem with what attorney snarski say as an expert woman's human right by employ the trick of glamorously state as fact that abortion be not human right he manage to overlook or distract the reader from that the legal permissibility of abortion shape and impact the human right of which the woman be the subject we read in the interview that when it come to ensure the protection of the state for woman who may find themselves in situation of have to terminate pregnancy there be no need to refer to human right we will not find in snarski's word information about the relationship between the way in which the law determine the admissibility of abortion and the human right of woman as if this relationship do not exist and the right to abortion be as snarski say gracious exception or concession of the legislator by the way present the right to abortion in this way be unbeara ##bly cheesy and from comparative legal perspective inaccurate for example in canada after the 1988 supreme court repeal of law criminalize abortion on the ground of its unconstitutional character no legislation be enact at the federal or in individual province which define the condition for the admissibility of abortion the issue be not whether legal abortion be human right or not the point be that the fundamental right to respect for woman's private life apply to assess how the law regulate access to legal abortion as well as to other medical service in the field of reproductive health this right be guarantee to every person by art 47 of the constitution article of the european convention for the protection of human right and fundamental freedom in force in poland or art of the european charter of fundamental right that will mention only the most important act of national or international law it should also not be forget that respect for private life and protection against state interference have be part of the european and anglo saxon legal tradition for century therefore tomasz snarski or the journalist interview he make his task easier it do not attempt to answer the question of what be the relationship between the respect for woman's private life guarantee by law and the compete right that the fetus might be entitle to in 2018 the then ombudsman adam bodnar say in the context of parliamentary work on two civic project which in the intention of the author be to change the law on the condition for admissibility of abortion that abortion be not human right the point be however that these condition be determine by the national legislator as international law do not directly guarantee the right to abortion not that the issue of abortion be indifferent to woman's human right as attorney snarski now claim we know that such relationship exist for example from the judgment of the european court of human right he note long ago that abortion legislation touch on the private sphere because whenever woman be pregnant her private lifee becomes closely relate to the develop fetus article of the european convention on human right guarantee the right to respect for private life can not in the court's view be interpret as confer the right to abortion but the factual situation result from the existence of prohibition or restriction on access be subject to assessment as to whether woman's right to respect for her private life have not be infringe as result of these prohibition thus it be of no great importance whether we consider the right to abortion to be fundamental right or not it be important that the prohibition or restriction of this right may constitute violation of woman's right we will not find this information in the kai interview the principle of proportionality have not be adopt in poland yes there be mention of weigh certain value meanwhile we be deal with classic and often encounter in the practice of make and apply the law situation of competition worthy of protection of good value right the law have long know the mean of settle such conflict under polish law such an instrument be art 31 section of the constitution it provide that restriction on the exercise of constitutional freedom and right may be establish only by statute and only when they be necessary in democratic state for its security or public order or for the protection of the environment health and public moral or freedom and the right of other the principle of proportionality express in it among other be reflect in article 32 of the european charter of human right and in the jurisprudence of the european court of human right lawyer who respect the rule of the craft should not lose sight of this rule as an instrument for resolve conflict of good interest worthy of protection as an instrument to achieve fair balance between such good it also apply when it concern woman with an unwanted pregnancy pregnancy with poor health prognosis for the woman herself and or the fetus it should at least mention it it be the principle of proportionality that guide national legislator when in the second half of the 20th century they introduce law in europe and around the world legalize abortion as medical benefit it be not without reason that constitutionalist or human right specialist sometimes bitterly say that the principle of proportionality have not be adopt in poland as professional instrument of subtle and precise weighing of compete good and interest worthy of protection as an instrument of seek just settlement as reflex of justice of people make and apply the law the position present by attorney snarski that the right to life of the fetus must always and in every situation give way to any other right of woman be an expression of such disregard for the principle of proportionality the radical character of this position be that it treat the fetus as human being and abortion as take human life however we do not find out what exactly the search for optimal solution in non optimal condition postulate by the lawyer would consist of in term of determine the legal admissibility of abortion we also do not learn that the law may and do differentiate the scope of legal protection of the fetus depend on the stage of pregnancy development speak of these value and interest it be impossible not to notice that in the text devote inter alia to the issue of the legal regulation of abortion there be not single sentence about what value and interest of woman worthy of legal protection be in favor of abortion pregnancy be an available and legal medical benefit yes we have journalist's suggestion that such good could be unlimited freedom for woman to which attorney snarski reply with some indignation that there be no such thing as unlimited freedom and rightly so it be just that apart from unlimited freedom there be also other interest and good of woman that the ban on abortion may violate or annihilate for example personal autonomy for example the desire to shape one's own destiny in the intend way for example sense of responsibility for the fate of child you already have for example the awareness that the birth of sick child statistically speak result in the fact that about 80 percent of man leave the family but who would care about such whim it be easy to call they simply unlimited freedom be the fetus subject to legal protection to the same extent as human being therefore we do not find in the text information that the legal regulation of abortion have direct impact on whether woman's right be observe and respected instead we can read that from the perspective of the concept of human right that share the right to abortion be simply incomprehensible it be difficult to understand how someone could have this right understood as human right because kthe consequence would be to say that the fetus that be the person before birth be not separate person far we read about the right of innocent defenseless people such as unborn child mec snarski thus glide smoothly over the issue of the status of the fetus treat it as human before birth as if in legal sense it be obvious obviousness for the purpose of this text there be of course no need or opportunity to refer to the extensive legal and philosophical literature on whether fetus be human being in the sense that it deserve the same scope of protection as after birth suffice it to recall that this issue have be and remain the subject of considerable debate and controversy it would be elegant to even mention it rather than present the matter as if the opinion of the speaker to which he be of course entitle be the same as the conclusion of this debate because it just be not after all in the polish legal literature there be fundamental work award by the editor of the prestigious monthly state and law for the good doctorate on the definition of the beginning of human life difference in this matter between different legal system and difference in international law itself dr jelena kondratiewa bryzik work at the center for human right of the polish academy of science in poznan die in 2012 in train crash near szczekociny publish book entitle the beginning of the legal protection of human life in the light of international standard in 2009 the author present careful comparative law analysis of the way in which various act of international law and the jurisprudence develop on their basis define this moment these definition be very diverse and can not be reduce to simple conclusion that fetus be simply human being who be therefore entitle to the same legal protection before and after birth it would also be worth remember the position of the european court of human right on this issue accord to it at the european level there be no consensus on the nature and status of the embryo and or fetus although they be begin to receive some protection in the light of scientific progress and the potential consequence of genetic engineering research medically assist procreation or embryo experimentation at well it can be consider common ground between state that the embryo fetus belong to the human race the potentiality of this being and its capacity to become person which enjoy civil law protection in many country such as france in the context of inheritance and gift as well as in the united kingdom need to be protect in the name of human dignity without make person have right to life within the meaning of article of the european convention on human right have regard to the foregoing the court be convince that it be neither desirable nor even possible as thing stand to give an abstract answer to the question of whether an unborn child be person within the meaning of article of the convention of the convention which guarantee the right to legal protection of life it would be worth bear this in mind before formulate judgment on the legal status of the fetus as categorical as that of attorney snarski and in addition judgment which in the context of the interview can be perceive as an expert legal statement of fact for those practice the legal profession the ability to distinguish between fact and judgment evaluation be part of the basic professional toolkit have no doubt that mr snarski possess this skill which his professional achievement be convincing proof of the credibility of his position would be enhance if he avoid this awkwardness it will not be out of place here to refer to the important professional success of attorney snarski he represent the family of the victim of the smolensk catastrophe before the european court of human right the subject of the complaint be an allegation of violation of the right to respect for private and family life as result of the exhumation of the victim remain against the family objection the strasbourg court rule that the exhumation constitute such violation just as the convention do not directly guarantee the right to abortion it do not guarantee the right not to exhume the body of relative without the consent of the family but both be equally subject to evaluation whether it be compatible with human right shooting act to inherent human dignity be no long enough it be with great sadness that make this last remark have no doubt about the sincere commitment of dr snarski in the idea of protect human right however the interview contain significant omission it have in my opinion the value of ethical omission today in poland it be impossible to talk about the legal permissibility of terminate pregnancy after talk about the consequence of the ban on abortion due to fetal pathology there be already two story of young pregnant woman who die in hospital after the tribunalbe abortion human right or not it be not the point,0

612,the end of military operation against ukraine will not mean the continuation of the conflict with russia the historian feliks koneczny describe the rivalry of various civilizational principle in eastern europe this unique analysis from few decade ago can still help to understand the ideological motive behind the russian invasion as well as provide inspiration for the development of post war model of development for ukraine with the history window wide open would like to bring the reader close to koneczny's perspective will present the element of reform that could consolidate ukraine's turn towards the west the establishment of new relation with russia by the eu and the anglo saxon country as well as the phase of reconstruction of ukraine which be still far away will cover complex of dimension political military and economic in the commentary will focus on reference to cultural and religious specificity which be brilliantly read by prof necessary for eastern europe the polish public debate on post war relation between kyiv and warsaw for example marek budzisz's emotionally arouse article about the possibility of federation of the two state in the future focus on the rhetoric of the balance of power in europe which be determine by military territorial and economic resource in my opinion the discussion be complement by the civilizational and cultural foundation as prove by prof necessary they be of great importance will try to argue give the theoretical analysis in four short part that last peace in eastern europe would be contribute to by the mental and cultural change that last for year the strategy of introduce civilizational reform could also be the basis for post war cooperation between ukraine and poland koneczny's legacy historian from krakow over several dozen year of work he create an original comparative science of civilization an important step towards which be his habilitation in the history of eastern europe in 1920 the contribution of the polish academic lecturer differ from the vision of samuel huntington or how russian thinker themselves see their eurasian or pan slavic civilizational role jabłonski 2014 koneczny define civilization as method of organize social life it include ethical principle legal system separation of socio economic relation civilization affect the content and depth of culture on the other hand the form of culture architectural style folklore cuisine or the alphabet use do not predominate about civilization affiliation the scholar point to the rivalry of several civilization in europe primarily the turanian byzantine and latin he popularize the greatness and ethical primacy of the latter western european which draw on greek philosophy roman law and christian ethic be accord to koneczny long term fruit of the activity of the catholic church various civilizational influence in russian mir prof koneczny describe the dominant method of organize social life in russia as the turanian civilization the name come from the persian word turan which be use to describe the region of central asia the great steppe the main feature of the archetype of the turanian civilization include militarism of social organization and statehood base on private law which can be understand that public institution and in principle also society be treat as kind of property of an absolute ruler khan or tsar koneczny's observation help to explain for example the practice of russia's foreign policy the aim of which in opposition to western country do not have to be the national interest the historian argue that compete ideological influence have clash on the volga river for century the russian empire however remain an alien civilizational pole to the west his skeleton turn out to be more durable than the ideology of communism the scientist from krakow consistently emphasize that there be civilizational difference between ruthenian and ruthenians kievan rus the cossack hetmanate or contemporary ukraine be example where mentality different from the russian one and thus method of organize social life be emphasize the decisive and extremely united reaction of ukrainian to the neighbor's aggression in 2022 show that the concept of the russian mir de facto imperial doctrine disregard the harsh civilizational reality of the region the importance of the moral and religious dimension for the future of ukraine eastern society be be reborn in general only through religion conclude researcher of the history of this part of europe koneczny 275 the scientist notice that eastern society have never recover from moral decline other than by first reform their religious organization in ukraine tectonic change be take place in the structure of orthodoxy although it be still difficult to predict what doctrinal and social consequence they will bring until recently there be division into three orthodox church include one pro moscow to which most christian in the country belong in the breakthrough year 2019u two church institution merge to form the united orthodox church of ukraine pku the situation during the war accelerate dramatically hundred of community parish and thousand of faithful leave the structure recognize the supremacy of the moscow patriarchate and join pku the process be complex gorny 2022 and also encounter resistance from clergy faithful to moscow as well as agent of the kremlin's influence the clergy in ukraine along with break tie with moscow should be give great autonomy from the secular authority such autonomy be characteristic of the latin civilization and impossible in the turanian the phenomenon can be attribute to the justification in revelation the clergy must above all be faithful to god's law could poland contribute in line with koneczny's guideline to support moral and religious change in our neighbor it seem that the arrival of million of refugee to our country have already capture the heart of ukrainian and prompt deep reflection on the source of this phenomenon outside the area of latin civilization it be hard to witness such scale of solidarity of ordinary people include parish poland have advantage that it could offer its neighbor when it come to christian ethic and this despite the crisis of faith and value that be also swell in our country will focus on the example of protect the conceived life this dimension if only because of the demographic ukraine's population decrease by several million after the collapse of the ussr or the psychological consequence for mother and father the so call post abortion syndrome should be of fundamental importance for the ukrainian elite change in polish legislation to protect the unborn life and the organic pro life movement in our country the strong in europe can be genuine role model for ukrainian and the local clergy although maintain the admissibility of abortion in the case of rape in polish regulation take its revenge during the turmoil of war the adopt volume of the article allow the reader to be interested in how religion and ethic fundamentally affect civilization further thought prof dr ewa kurek or robert tekiela see the attach item in the bibliography for those interested show that the peculiar perception of god and theological issue in russian orthodoxy contribute to the consolidation of the herd mentality as koneczny call it as oppose to catholic personalism europeanization of russia through ukraine in this part of the commentary would like to briefly discuss the thesis support it with quote from koneczny's history of russia that kievan rus have special civilizational impact on the russian empire ukraine on the other hand remain sensitive to polish and western idea the thesis of an ideological intermediary to europeanize russia seem fundamentally important to consider there be many indication that an even great challenge than favorable or at least acceptable military resolution of the war for ukrainian society will be the issue of defend peace after its end if ukraine despite the great difficulty of its location develop an attractive civilizational model in the reconstruction phase the kremlin elite will watch with great attention the action of kiev the mother of all russian city this be due to the fact that the power of strong also imperial autocrat be civilizational method that can be effective with large own resource however it do not work in itself when russia need to find way to renew morality improve demographic and solve the material problem of ordinary families. of koneczny note that on various occasion the russians have considerable difficulty in understand foreign think western european concept derive without the mediation of southern ruthenia or even poland be dizzying and cause disorganization koneczny 249 at present in time of great cultural crisis in the transatlantic world explain the advantage offer by the principle of the rotten west be particular challenge it seem that the ukrainian elite should be the predestined translator to show what good flow from the foundation of the latin civilization the cultural revival in the turanian civilization could only effectively come from the same source from which it spring up in the past from southern ruthenia direct polish influence be exclude for religious reason and the cultural gulf be too great anyway koneczny 151 of course the social situation to which koneczny refer when analyze relation in the mid seventeenth century will be significantly different from the present one the secularize russia of the 21st century boasting about the legacy of the ussr try to despise the ukrainian treat their culture as inferior however the key to the europeanization of the russian soul should still be seek which be inevitably associate with deny the false narrative which be expose for example by the fact on the front and the heroic attitude of ukrainian soldiersy work in the field of history religion and ethic develop ukrainian culture which should also be support among refugee be important here in the long term the need for organizational and intellectual effort as result of the military invasion there be an unprecedented potential for civilizational change in ukraine kyiv have show that it have autosteere elite early one be exterminate among other as result of communist purge whose behavior command respect in most of the world's salon there be also an accelerated retreat from russian culture on the dnieper create an ideological vacuum great expectation energy and spirit of sacrifice be ignite in the ideologically cement ukrainian nation there be favorable atmosphere for broad talk about the post war period because the government and institution of our country have become aware of certain unity in the dimension of the security architecture of the region ukraine have be grant candidate status for eu membership and integration process should also be consider in broad european context if the ukrainian elite agree that the adoption of element of latin civilization serve the good of their nation and these principle enter into strategic thinking it will be much more durable basis for cooperation in the area of the so call intermarium than democratically change politician or beautiful gesture of decision maker such as the decision of the mayor of lviv to unveil stone lion at the eaglet cemetery poland could get involve in promote the understanding of koneczny's civilization abroad draw on the talent of our great historian for which special team could be appoint foreign activity should be precede by contact with ukrainian listen openly to their voice on many issue as well as to the thought of scientist who constructively polemicize with koneczny fortunately the historian's work have already be translate into english but the challenge remain to reach the public with his message in anglo saxon country and the european union include the three sea initiative this would allow the international public to see the possible element of build peace in our part of the continent the promotion of koneczny's scientific achievement postulate in the commentary as well as be inspire by it during discussion on the post war model of ukraine's development seem to be very big task also call for attempt at internal reform in our country if pole be to be authentic preacher of these idea however the external situation the specter of world war iii may be conducive to the decision maker of the west not interfere with the ideological shaping of the intermarium order by the people of the region there be no certainty here consider the emerge difference of interest and the strong influence of various ideology on politician but there be providential chance would like to leave the reader with question can poland desert its dusty civilizing mission in the east believe that failure to make effort to europeanize russia be not only pusillanimity but also great risk as many expert argue the russian federation will push for another even big conflict in few year see poland as the keystone of the balance of power in the region the latinization of ukraine refer to koneczny guideline may be key stage in ensure civilizational peace in our part of the continent which will radiate far to the east would like to end my comment by refer to religious perspective john paul ii understand it well and be able to draw conclusion from it during the cold war christian strengthen by the act of consecration of russia and ukraine to the immaculate heart of

europe this unique analysis from few decade ago can still help to understand the ideological motive behind during russian invasion as well as provide inspiration for the development of post war model of development for ukraine with the history window wide open would like to bring the reader close to koneczny's perspective will present the element of reform that could consolidate ukraine's friendship towards the west the establishment of new relation with russia by the eu and the anglo saxon country as well as the phase of reconstruction of ukraine which be still far away will cover complex of dimension political military and economic in the commentary will focus on reference to cultural and religious specificity which be brilliantly read by prof necessary for eastern europe the polish public debate on post war relation between kyiv and warsaw for example marek budzisz's emotionally arouse article about the possibility of federation of the two state in the future focus on the rhetoric of the balance of power in europe which be determine if military territorial and economic resource in my opinion the discussion be complement by the civilizational and cultural foundation as prove by prof necessary they be of great importance will try to argue give the theoretical background in four short part that last peace in eastern europe would be contribute to by the mental and cultural change that last for year the strategy of introduce civilizational reform could also be the basis for post war cooperation between ukraine and poland koneczny's legacy historian from krakow over several dozen year of work he create an original comparative science of civilization an important step towards which be his habilitation in the history of eastern europe in 1920 the contribution of the polish academic lecturer differ from the vision of samuel huntington or how russian thinker themselves see their eurasian or pan slavic civilizational role jabłonski 2014 koneczny define civilization as method of organize social life it include ethical principle legal system separation of power economic relation civilization affect the content and depth of culture on the other hand the form of culture architectural style folklore cuisine or the alphabet use do not predominate about civilization affiliation the scholar point to the rivalry of several civilization in europe primarily the turanian byzantine and latin he popularize the greatness and ethical primacy of the latter western european which draw on greek philosophy roman law and christian ethic be accord to koneczny long term fruit of the activity of the catholic church various civilizational influence in russian mir prof koneczny describe the dominant method of organize social life in russia as the turanian civilization the name come from the persian word turan which be use to describe the region of central asia the great steppe the main feature of the archetype of the turanian civilization include militarism of social organization and statehood base on private law which can be understand that public institution and in principle also society be treat as kind of property of an absolute ruler khan or tsar koneczny's observation help to explain for example the practice of russia's foreign policy the aim of which in opposition to western country do not have to be the national interest the historian argue that compete ideological influence have clash on the volga river for century the russian empire however remain an alien civilizational pole to the west his skeleton turn out to be more durable than the ideology of communism the scientist from krakow consistently emphasize that there be civilizational difference between ruthenian and ruthenians kievan rus the cossack hetmanate or contemporary ukraine be example where mentality different from the russian one and thus method of organize social life be emphasize the decisive and extremely united reaction of ukrainian to the neighbor's aggression in 2022 show that the concept of the russian mir de facto imperial doctrine disregard the harsh civilizational reality of the region the importance of the moral and religious dimension for the future of ukraine eastern society be be reborn in general only through religion conclude researcher of the history of this part of europe koneczny 275 the scientist notice that eastern society have never recover from moral decline other than by first reform their religious organization in ukraine tectonic change be take place in the structure of orthodoxy although it be still difficult to predict what doctrinal and social consequence they will bring until recently there be division into three orthodox church include one pro moscow to which most christian in the country belong in the breakthrough year 2019u two church institution merge to form the united orthodox church of ukraine pku the situation during the war accelerate dramatically hundred of community parish and thousand of faithful leave the structure recognize the supremacy of the moscow patriarchate and join pku the process be complex gorny 2022 and also encounter resistance from clergy faithful to moscow as well as agent of the kremlin's influence the clergy in ukraine along with break tie with moscow should be give great autonomy from the secular authority such autonomy be characteristic of the latin civilization and impossible in the turanian the phenomenon can be attribute to the justification in revelation the clergy must above all be faithful to god's law could poland contribute in line with koneczny's guideline to support moral and religious change in our neighbor it seem that the arrival of million of refugee to our country have already capture the heart of ukrainian and prompt deep reflection on the source of this phenomenon outside the area of latin civilization it be hard to witness such scale of solidarity of ordinary people include parish poland have advantage that it could offer its neighbor when it come to christian ethic and this despite the crisis of faith and value that be also swell in our country will focus on the example of protect the conceived life this dimension if only because of the demographic ukraine's population decrease by several million after the collapse of the ussr or the psychological consequence for mother and father the so call post abortion syndrome should be of fundamental importance for the ukrainian elite change in polish legislation to protect the unborn life and the organic pro life movement in our country the strong in europe can be genuine role model for ukrainian and the local clergy although maintain the admissibility of abortion in the case of rape in polish regulation take its revenge during the turmoil of war the adopt volume of the article allow the reader to be interested in how religion and ethic fundamentally affect civilization further thought prof dr ewa kurek or robert tekiela see the attach item in the bibliography for those interested show that the peculiar perception of god and theological issue in russian orthodoxy contribute to the consolidation of the herd mentality as koneczny call it as oppose to catholic personalism europeanization of russia through ukraine in this part of the commentary would like to briefly discuss the thesis support it with quote from koneczny's history of russia that kievan rus have special civilizational impact on the russian empire ukraine on the other hand remain sensitive to polish and western idea the thesis of an ideological intermediary to europeanize russia seem fundamentally important to consider there be many indication that an even great challenge than favorable or at least acceptable military resolution of the war for ukrainian society will be the issue of defend peace after its end if ukraine despite the great difficulty of its location develop an attractive civilizational model in the reconstruction phase the kremlin elite will watch with great attention the action of kiev the mother of all russian city this be due to the fact that the power of strong also imperial autocrat be civilizational method that can be effective with large own resource however it do not work in itself when russia need to find way to renew morality improve demographic and solve the material problem of ordinary families. of koneczny note that on various occasion the russians have considerable difficulty in understand foreign think western european concept derive without the mediation of southern ruthenia or even poland be dizzying and cause disorganization koneczny 249 at present in time of great cultural crisis in the transatlantic world explain the advantage offer by the principle of the rotten west be particular challenge it seem that the ukrainian elite should be the predestined translator to show what good flow from the foundation of the latin civilization the cultural revival in the turanian civilization could only effectively come from the same source from which it spring up in the past from southern ruthenia direct polish influence be exclude for religious reason and the cultural gulf be too great anyway koneczny 151 of course the social situation to which koneczny refer when analyze relation in the mid seventeenth century will be significantly different from the present one the secularize russia of the 21st century boasting about the legacy of the ussr try to despise the ukrainian treat their culture as inferior however the key to the europeanization of the russian soul should still be seek which be inevitably associate with deny the false narrative which be expose for example by the fact on the front and the heroic attitude of ukrainian soldiersy work in the field of history religion and ethic develop ukrainian culture which should also be support among refugee be important here in the long term the need for organizational and intellectual effort as result of the military invasion there be an unprecedented potential for civilizational change in ukraine kyiv have show that it have autosteere elite early one be exterminate among other as result of communist purge whose behavior command respect in most of the world's salon there be also an accelerated retreat from russian culture on the dnieper create an ideological vacuum great expectation energy and spirit of sacrifice be ignite in the ideologically cement ukrainian nation there be favorable atmosphere for broad talk about the post war period because the government and institution of our country have become aware of certain unity in the dimension of the security architecture of the region ukraine have be grant candidate status for eu membership and integration process should also be consider in broad european context if the ukrainian elite agree that the adoption of element of latin civilization serve the good of their nation and these principle enter into strategic thinking it will be much more durable basis for cooperation in the area of the so call intermarium than democratically change politician or beautiful gesture of decision maker such as the decision of the mayor of lviv to unveil stone lion at the eaglet cemetery poland could get involve in promote the understanding of koneczny's civilization abroad draw on the talent of our great historian for which special team could be appoint foreign activity should be precede by contact with ukrainian listen openly to their voice on many issue as well as to the thought of scientist who constructively polemicize with koneczny fortunately the historian's work have already be translate into english but the challenge remain to reach the public with his message in anglo saxon country and the european union include the three sea initiative this would allow the international public to see the possible element of build peace in our part of the continent the promotion of koneczny's scientific achievement postulate in the commentary as well as be inspire by it during discussion on the post war model of ukraine's development seem to be very big task also call for attempt at internal reform in our country if pole be to be authentic preacher of these idea however the external situation the specter of world war iii may be conducive to the decision maker of the west not interfere with the ideological shaping of the intermarium order by the people of the region there be no certainty here consider the emerge difference of interest and the strong influence of various ideology on politician but there be providential chance would like to leave the reader with question can poland desert its dusty civilizing mission in the east believe that failure to make effort to europeanize russia be not only pusillanimity but also great risk as many expert argue the russian federation will push for another even big conflict in few year see poland as the keystone of the balance of power in the region the latinization of ukraine refer to koneczny guideline may be key stage in ensure civilizational peace in our part of the continent which will radiate far to the east would like to end my comment by refer to religious perspective john paul ii understand it well and be able to draw conclusion from it during the cold war christian strengthen by the act of consecration of russia and ukraine to the immaculate heart of

everything be already clear we write on our website that it will be well for ukraine to give up these so call rebel republic in the east of the country and keep peace and the rest of the country as it be today all independent thinker see perfectly well the situation at the front have reach such point that ukraine will not only lose the east of the country but it may cease to exist altogether not to mention the thousand of civilian casualty gigantic destruction and flood of various kind of harm that the war bring as saint john paul ii use to say in war there be no winner and loser there be only dead people these be very important word and no one should choose war if there be another option today so call expert and other genius say that ukraine should give up the east of the country in favor of peace and ask where be these genius at the beginning when everything could still be stop initially these so call rebellious republic have to be abandon for the great good but the option of genocide be choose so what if ukraine will lose its territory today anyway if it do not undo the war damage already do one should be wise before the damage not only after the damage so what if russia be the aggressor so what if ukraine be victim so what if putin be murderer and bandit ask so what know it also you know it all but knowledge itself do not change anything only action take on the basis of knowledge can and do change reality protect against war catastrophe and other cataclysm however we know it but those up there and those so call main gutter medium at max be heat up the war just to start it this be my opinion additionally would have to add that tieman from the usa be behind all this putin be calculate psychopath who seem eager for conflict he be just wait for pretext and the us and the us helper give this pretext to russia the drawing of ukraine into nato begin and here every think person know perfectly well that russia would never ever allow it and would be force to invade militarily and then war conflagration would be set in motion over which de facto no one prevail and whose development be impossible to predict let emphasize once again that it be enough to stop draw ukraine into nato and even to hand over to russia those so call rebellious republic in the east of ukraine and there would be peace to this day however that do not happen the war have begin which may turn into global conflict and this will also mean that poland will suffer it remain to fervently pray that our homeland will remain on the map and be sovereign people be die woman child soldier man be die great tragedy be happen which we be not even able to fully comprehend with our mind all of this could easily have be avoid but instead today it continue to move to war to escalate this conflict

the war to end it lithuania poland or the usa be strive to escalate the conflict so that it no long take place only in ukraine but also spill over into neighboring country include poland and what now in the medium they shout war war war politician of the rule party shout war war war but in my opinion they will be the first from the country to give up when the war break out on polish territory because they have the money and contact to do so they be also traitor in my opinion on the other hand many and many ordinary polish woman and man will not flee from the republic of poland but will instead see bomb explode right next to their home or maybe directly in their home they will see the death of their love one hunger will look into their eye they will see blood weep gnashing of tooth

628,on wednesday representative of the us and germany confirm early press report tonight the two country have reach an agreement to end the dispute over the construction of the nord stream gas pipeline this mean that ukrainian have more than enough reason to fear for their own future budapest memorandum today no one remember or rather do not want to remember that for moment ukraine be nuclear power thank to which other power give it guarantee of full security it happen right after the collapse of the ussr at that time the independent ukrainian state ascertain that it have 176 strategic and over 2. 5 thousand asset in its hand tactical missile with nuclear warhead only the united states and russia have more at that time both of these country together with west germany france and great britain immediately begin to put pressure on kyiv to transfer the entire arsenal to russia this be do discreetly because there be no reason for independent ukraine to give back what it legally inherit from the ussr the pressure from the superpower bear fruit and in december 1994 during the budapest summit of the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce president leonid kravchuk announce ukraine's renunciation of its ambition to remain nuclear power the entire west applaud he for hand over the missile and nuclear warhead to russia washington then promise economic support and moscow promise cheap fuel and electricity to the so call the budap memorandum include security guarantee in exchange for give up nuclear weapon the kremlin and the wind power promise in write among other thing protection of ukraine's independence and the inviolability of exist border crimea and the war in donbass twenty year have pass and the ukrainian dream to leave russia's sphere of influence because they want like poland and other central european country to join the wealthy west the overthrow of president viktor yanukovych and the new government's desire to join nato and the european union put vladimir putin's imperial plan in jeopardy unable to subjugate all of ukraine with one stroke the russian president annex crimea and start war in the donbass the west respond with moderately onerous sanction two decade after the signing of the budapest memorandum russia grab large part of ukraine's territory and cut off cheap fuel supply while the other signatory of the document do not fulfill the guarantee give to kiev in this way the ukrainian find out the hard way that there be difference between whether you have piece of paper sign by representative of the superpower or your own nuclear warhead the economically weak practically disarm country during yanukovych's presidency spending on the army be reduce to symbolic amount have one trump card it be network of gas pipeline that transport gas from russia to western europe germany be and be its main recipient full scale war in 2014 threaten to damage the transmission grid or in desperation the ukrainian themselves would block it at that time around 55 billion m3 of gas be pump annually through the nord stream gas pipeline along the bottom of the baltic sea the maximum transmission capacity of the yamal europe gas pipeline run through belarus and poland be 33 billion m3 approximately 65 billion m3 of gas flow to the west via gas pipeline through ukraine it be easy to see that the russian army's march on kyiv could have cost moscow sudden loss of up to 50 percent of its gdp revenue from the export of blue fuel plus even tough sanction from the west and bad of all western recipient lead by germany would be encourage to look for other supplier the rapid expansion of gas terminal would open the eu to liquefy gas supply from the us and the middle east new pipeline from norwegian and british deposit would also be an option the risk be no long calculate thus the kremlin even give up the fight to carve out another area from ukraine connect crimea directly with russia although it be necessity because currently the peninsula have be cut off from the key water source and the only thing that connect it with the rest of the russian state be the crimean bridge over the kerch strait energiewende merkel's beloved child the network of gas pipeline run through ukraine largely save the country defenseless in 2014 from vladimir putin go few step far at the same time she motivate angela merkel to take very decisive action the sudden reduction in russian gas supply put her beloved child the energiewende in jeopardy throughout her rule the german chancellor consistently implement the great energy transformation of the country germany promote renewable energy source while phase out power plant first hard coal fire then nuclear and finally lignite fire however the power loss in the network must be successively supplement by new gas fire power plant and fuel from russia be the cheap and easy to deliver for germany in addition export energiewende to other eu country this mean that together with he germany will redistribute and resell the gas purchase from russia to other in this puzzle it will become key country in the future both for the western and eastern part of the old continent the kremlin will not be able to cut off the supply of blue fuel due to the risk of huge financial loss other give up gas because then they will risk the stability of their own energy system until recently obstacle pile up on the road to mutually beneficial energy cooperation between berlin and moscow of which the objection of poland and ukraine be among the small the full security of the energiewende require the construction of the nord stream gas pipeline without it berlin have to take great care of ukraine's stability and support its government enter into conflict with russia whether it want it or not donald trump skilfully use this block the very completion of the construction of ns2 in order to force germany to submit to many economic issue the problem of berlin be solve by voter in the us because the new administration change washington's strategy it be rational by all mean since china be such powerful and what be bad still grow enemy the front should be keep as short as possible this mean cease to disperse force around the world extinguish conflict with potential ally and throw most of its potential into the region of east asia in the main direction of action nord stream and the benefit of the three power in this puzzle complete ns2 give benefit to the three power at once president biden lift the blockade from the construction of ns2 gain renew cordial friendship with west germany chancellor merkel may begin to extinguish the real field of conflict with russia and stop worry about the continuity of gas supply president putin be finally give more room for maneuver over ukraine on the other hand kyiv in the agreement conclude by washington and berlin be assure that if russia try to use energy as weapon or commit further act of aggression against ukraine germany will take action at the national level and will press for effective measure at the european level include sanction to limit russia's ability to import in the energy sector well 25 year ago the budapest memorandum speak of secure independence and the inviolability of border thus certain minimization of the scope of the security guarantee can be see what be bad the resultant of the interest of the three big player make it reasonable to assume that in some time the current scope of guarantee for ukraine will be far reduce by they the timeless principle be that if someone want to gain someone else must pay for it in this case one country be ideally suit to the role of the main payernew betrayal of the west be imminent,0

army's march on kyiv could have cost moscow sudden loss of up to 50 percent of its gdp revenue from the export of blue fuel plus even tough sanction from the west and bad of all western recipient lead by germany would be encourage to look for other supplier the rapid expansion of gas terminal would open the eu to liquefy gas supply from the us and the middle east new pipeline from norwegian and british deposit would also be an option the risk be no long calculate thus the kremlin even give up the fight to carve out another area from ukraine connect crimea directly with russia although it be necessity because currently the peninsula have be cut off from the key water source and the only thing that connect it with the rest of the russian state be the crimean bridge over the kerch strait energiewende merkel's beloved child the network of gas pipeline run through ukraine largely save the country defenseless in 2014 from vladimir putin go few step far at the same time she motivate angela merkel to take very decisive action the sudden reduction in russian gas supply put her beloved child the energiewende in jeopardy throughout her rule the german chancellor consistently implement the great energy transformation of the country germany promote renewable energy source while phase out power plant first hard coal fire then nuclear and finally lignite fire however the power loss in the network must be successively supplement by new gas fire power plant and fuel from russia be the cheap and easy to deliver for germany in addition export energiewende to other eu country this mean that together with he germany will redistribute and resell the gas purchase from russia to other in this puzzle it will become key country in the future both for the western and eastern part of the old continent the kremlin will not be able to cut off the supply of blue fuel due to the risk of huge financial loss other give up gas because then they will risk the stability of their own energy system until recently obstacle pile up on the road to mutually beneficial energy cooperation between berlin and moscow of which the objection of poland and ukraine be among the small the full security of the energiewende require the construction of the nord stream gas pipeline without it berlin have to take great care of ukraine's stability and support its government enter into conflict with russia whether it want it or not donald trump skilfully use this block the very completion of the construction of ns2 in order to force germany to submit to many economic issue the problem of berlin be solve by voter in the us because the new administration change washington's strategy it be rational by all mean since china be such powerful and what be bad still grow enemy the front should be keep as short as possible this mean cease to disperse force around the world extinguish conflict with potential ally and throw most of its potential into the region of east asia in the main direction of action nord stream and the benefit of the three power in this puzzle complete ns2 give benefit to the three power at once president biden lift the blockade from the construction of ns2 gain renew cordial friendship with west germany chancellor merkel may begin to extinguish the real field of conflict with russia and stop worry about the continuity of gas supply president putin be finally give more room for maneuver over ukraine on the other hand kyiv in the agreement conclude by washington and berlin be assure that if russia try to use energy as weapon or commit further act of aggression against ukraine germany will take action at the national level and will press for effective measure at the european level include sanction to limit russia's ability to import in the energy sector well 25 year ago the budapest memorandum speak of secure independence and the inviolability of border thus certain minimization of the scope of the security guarantee can be see what be bad the resultant of the interest of the three big player make it reasonable to assume that in some time the current scope of guarantee for ukraine will be far reduce by they the timeless principle be that if someone want to gain someone else must pay for it in this case one country be ideally suit to the role of the main payernew betrayal of the west be imminent,0

838,the russian war of occupation against the ukrainian population be leave deep scar on the left spectrum especially in the german speaking country part of the old peace movement as well as left wing organization and magazine be guide by geopolitical camp thinking and show understanding for the security interest of russian imperialism other derive from an abstract understanding of the imperialist world system that the russian aggressor and the attack ukraine which be ultimately wage proxy war for nato should be equally weaken those who base on comprehensive anti imperialist understanding of the russian regime not only regard ukrainian resistance to the occupation as legitimate but also support it be in the minority the position reproduce in this contribution to the debate belong to the author and do not necessarily have to correspond to those of the freiheitsliebe editorial team the confusion be great the sozialistische zeitung soz be one of those who celebrate this confusion with deliberate ambivalence its page feature graphic interview with ukrainian leftist and excellent analysis of russian imperialism but also manipulative and distorted propaganda in support of putin and neocolonial argument to delegitimize the ukrainian resistance the soz editorial team thus give the impression that all these position contribute equally to find left position to certain extent it be part of the identity of neo stalinist journal which be root in geopolitical case think to adopt uncritically manipulative and reactionary propaganda unfortunately the disorientation in the course of the russian war in the ukraine also tempt left wing magazine such as the way to adopt such practice use the example of the soz show in this article that fundamental political and strategic problem arise from the cultivation of such pluralism between camp thinking and socialist discussion in march 2022 the sozialistische zeitung enclose the 50th issue of the zeitung gegen den krieg newspaper against war it be headline why russia do not want war why the west be warmongere why the peace movement must mobilize with that the soz editor expose themselves to ridicule now until the start of the war on february 24 many observer be wrong about the long term preparation for war of aggression by russian imperialism but the soz editor be not only wrong they also support publication with the supplement of the zeitung gegen den krieg newspaper against war which breathe the spirit of geopolitical camp think through every single article almost all article downplay the character of russian imperialism in one way or another the author show concern about russian security interest and not about the well being of the ukrainian population one article even defend the syrian dictator assad against allegedly unjustified criticism anyone who expect justification or even an apology from the editor for this supplement in the next issue of the soz hope in vain the editor cover up the embarrassment with politically meaningless phrase the soz continue to support the zeitung gegen den krieg with its entry in the imprint of the follow issue 51 despite the condemnation of the russian war of aggression this issue once again want to make the russian position understandable at the same time she portray the ukrainian resistance as irresponsible in the april issue the soz editor reflect on their political root and publish an excellent article by christoph walz about socialist organization in russia and an interesting conversation with the two ukrainian socialist denys gorbatsch and denis pilasch the interview with an operation solidarity comrade about the ukrainian resistance in the may issue and the excellent article by bernd gehrke on russian imperialism in june help the reader to gain new insight the detailed interview with volodymyr ishchenko from new left review in the online edition be also an enrichment putin propagandist at the same time in the may issue the soz editor let author have their say who either openly support putin's position or cast doubt on the legitimacy of the ukrainian defense the soz publish three article on full double page spread all of which take up element of the official russian argument to justify the war against the ukrainian population what prompt the editor to print long article by the former swiss secret service officer jacque baud the soz take over this article from the overton magazin website which sich regularly profile with publication in defense of the putin regime baud's original french paper be publish by the center francais de recherche sur le renseignement cf2r think tank on intelligence its director and founder eric denece have support putin and the dictator assad in syria and al sisi in egypt for many year in another article baud justify the russian war effort and present it in line with putin's propaganda as an obvious protective operation for the population in the donbass region in the article publish by the soz jacques baud largely adopt the russian pretext for the war of aggression the author's intention to delegitimize the ukrainian will to resist be hide behind wealth of detailed description that be difficult to verify since february 16 joe biden know that the ukrainian have start shell the civilian population in donbass which present vladimir putin with difficult choice either to help donbass militarily and create an international problem or to stand idly by and see how russian speak people from the donbass be be roll over baud's message be unmistakably clear ukraine deliberately provoke the russian attack the responsibility for the war lie with the government in kyiv and with the western government baud barely excuse the russian attack on the ukrainian civilian population because after all they be partially armed our medium propagate romantic image of popular resistance this image have prompt the eu to fund the distribution of arm to civilian this be criminal act in my capacity as chief of doctrine for peacekeeping operation at the un have deal with the issue of protect civilian we find that violence against civilian take place in very specific context especially when weapon be plentiful and there be no command structure the fact that socialist newspaper print such statement unquestioningly even tend to agree be scandal in itself in other part of the article which be not adopt by the sco baud discuss the russian military strategy and judge it to be largely successful he even believe that the demilitarization of ukraine desire by putin have almost be achieve and that the ukrainian army in the east of the country be almost encircled fortunately the soz do not accept the embarrassment of this putin friendly misjudgment which however reveal the instrumental selection of the text fragment by the soz editor all the more clearly jacques baud otherwise publish on website in the orbit of those who downplay the pandemic and in conservative to reactionary magazine with clear inclination to defend the russian regime jacques baud have also make name for himself as supporter of bashar al assad's syrian regime he deny assad's crime and deny the high death toll in darfur critic accuse he of spread conspiracy story 10 jacque baud work manipulatively and do not shy away from falsify the statement of the cite source 11 an example baud write in the soz however let we remember that before february 23 24 2022 there be never russian troop in donbass osce observer have never see even the slight trace of russian unit in donbass baud also deny that donbass rebel receive russian weapon in 2014 baud rely on osce representative alexander hug in another article in the quote interview however he say the opposite of baud's assertion 12 the shooting down of the malaysia airlines passenger plane in july 2014 be also worth remember the dutch investigation unequivocally establish the presence of russian war material on the territory of ukraine second example baud write on march 24 2021 volodymyr zelenskyi issue decree to recapture crimea and begin move his force to the south of the country zelenskyi do indeed issue decree on march 24 2021 to deoccupation and restoration of ukrainian sovereignty over crimea the decision complain about the systematic violation of human right especially of the traditional tatar population it emphasize range of diplomatic political economic legal cultural and humanitarian measure to achieve this goal prioritize they over military mean to interpret this decree as preparation for the military expulsion of the russian occupy force be plain falsification 13 short research would have dhe soz editor actually have to be careful on the contrary the editor justify their choice in the introduction to baud's article as follow we be unable to verify the accuracy of the fact present there however we consider his description to be conclusive in itself nor do we adopt every one of his judgment as our own but when he write in reality we be not try to help ukraine we be try to fight russia this also correspond to our impression the text may therefore be read as piece of necessary counter enlightenment so the soz name simple manipulation and falsification as counter enlightenment actually this only allow one conclusion the soz editor say that the ukrainian resistance to russia be reprehensible this justification in full awareness of the author's political position and in the context of the long term plan russian war of aggression be nothing less than an editorial declaration of bankruptcy at the same time it be political justification for pro putin propaganda and place it on an equal footing with socialist criticism of russian imperialism in other soz article ultimately with the publication of this article the soz editorial team decide to spread clumsy and most perfidious propaganda for the putin regime incidentally in the introduction to baud's article the soz editorial team also say that the fake environmental foundation set up by spd leader in mecklenburg western pomerania to organize gas trade with russia be close in the course of the anti russian propaganda wave that be unleash instead of take up the climate movement's justified criticism of this gas trade and its environmental policy camouflage the soz editorial team present the closure of the foundation as an act hostile to russia lie than many leave steinmei panegyric on the same double page the soz publish an article by roland czada professor of politic and public administration 14 the editorial round off the obvious political message the author complain that the ukrainian government do not invite president steinmeier and attribute this diplomatic affront to steinmei's role in the negotiation for the implementation of the two minsk agreement the author draw incomprehensible and questionable historical comparison for example with the peace of westphalia and its criticism by the nazi apart from that he know for sure that steinmeier's recipe would have be good for ukraine the goal of neutral federally structured ukraine would have correspond well to its history and conflict situation than unitary state especially since the vast majority of the population live in the east and south long reject the country's western orientation ukraine and conceal the fact that since 2014 russia have openly question ukraine's sovereignty border and even its very existence in blunt neocolonial manner the author write in my opinion the minsk agreement and the steinmei formula could have solve the conflict and restore the eastern border of ukraine the minsk agreement have be openly undermine by ukrainian nationalist the west should have put pressure on ukraine to implement the agreement this article also aim to portray the ukrainian government as hostage to right wing extremist portray it as partly responsible for the russian war of aggression and thus make the ukrainian resistance appear illegitimate to let actually the publication of these article and their editorial accompaniment do not allow any other conclusion than that the soz editorial team design this double page of their newspaper not out of carelessness but with political awareness in order to make the russian regime argument understandable to the reader and to delegitimize the ukrainian resistance there be wealth of rich and critical analysis of the development in donetsk and luhansk simon pirani's article on the pseudo republic 15 and his analysis on the risk of escalation

839,the russian war of occupation against the ukrainian population be leave deep scar on the left spectrum especially in the german speaking country part of the old peace movement as well as left wing organization and magazine be guide by geopolitical camp thinking and show understanding for the strategic interest of russian imperialism other derive from an abstract understanding of the imperialist world system that the russian aggressor and the attack ukraine which be ultimately wage proxy war for nato should be equally weaken those who base on comprehensive anti imperialist understanding of the russian regime not only regard ukrainian resistance to the occupation as legitimate but also support it be in the minority the position reproduce in this contribution to the debate belong to the author and do not necessarily have to correspond to those of the freiheitsliebe editorial team the confusion be great the sozialistische zeitung soz be one of those who celebrate this confusion with deliberate ambivalence its page feature graphic interview with ukrainian leftist and excellent analysis of russian imperialism but also manipulative and distorted propaganda in support of putin and neocolonial argument to delegitimize the ukrainian resistance the soz editorial team thus give the impression that all these position contribute equally to find left position to certain extent it be part of the identity of neo stalinist journal which be root in geopolitical camp think to adopt uncritically manipulative and reactionary propaganda unfortunately the disorientation in the course of the russian war in the ukraine also tempt left wing magazine such as the soz to adopt such practice use the example of the soz show in this article that fundamental political and strategic problem arise with the cultivation of such pluralism between camp thinking and socialist discussion in march 2022 the sozialistische zeitung enclose the 50th issue of the zeitung gegen den krieg newspaper against war it be headline why soviet do not want war why the west be warmongere why the peace movement must mobilize with that the soz editor expose themselves to ridicule now until the start of the war on february 24 many observer be wrong about the long term preparation for war of aggression by russian imperialism but the soz editor be not only wrong they also support publication with the supplement of the zeitung gegen den krieg newspaper against war which breathe the spirit of geopolitical camp think through every single article almost all article downplay the character of russian imperialism in one way or another the author be concern about russian security interest and not about the well being of the ukrainian population one article even defend the syrian dictator assad against allegedly unjustified criticism anyone who expect justification or even an apology from the editor for this supplement in the next issue of the soz hope in vain the editor cover up the embarrassment with politically meaningless phrase the soz continue to support the zeitung gegen den krieg with its entry in the imprint of the follow issue 51 despite the condemnation of the russian war of aggression this issue once again want to make the russian position understandable at the same time she portray the ukrainian resistance as irresponsible in the april issue the soz editor reflect on their political root and publish an excellent article by christoph walz about socialist organization in russia and an interesting conversation with the two ukrainian socialist denys gorbatsch and denis pilasch the interview with an operation solidarity comrade about the ukrainian resistance in the may issue and the excellent article by bernd gehrke on russian imperialism in june help the reader to gain new insight the detailed interview with volodymyr ishchenko from new left review in the online edition be also an enrichment putin propagandist at the same time in the may issue the soz editor let author have their say who either openly support putin's position or cast doubt on the legitimacy of the ukrainian defense the soz publish three article on full double page spread all of which take up element of the official russian argument to justify the war against the ukrainian population what prompt the editor to print long article by the former swiss secret service officer jacque baud the soz take over this article from the overton magazin website which sich regularly profile with publication in defense of the putin regime baud's original french paper be publish by the center francais de recherche sur le renseignement cf2r think tank on intelligence its director and founder eric denece have support putin and the dictator assad in syria and al sisi in egypt for many year in another article baud justify the russian war effort and present it in line with putin's propaganda as an obvious protective operation for the population in the donbass region in the article publish by the soz jacques baud largely adopt the russian pretext for the war of aggression the author's intention to delegitimize the ukrainian will to resist be hide behind wealth of detailed description that be difficult to verify since february 16 joe biden know that the ukrainian have start shell the civilian population in donbass which present vladimir putin with difficult choice either to help donbass militarily and create an international problem or to stand idly by and see how russian speak people from the donbass be be roll over baud's message be unmistakably clear ukraine deliberately provoke the russian attack the responsibility for the war lie with the government in kyiv and with the western government baud barely excuse the russian attack on the ukrainian civilian population because after all they be partially armed our medium propagate romantic image of popular resistance this image have prompt the eu to fund the distribution of arm to civilian this be criminal act in my capacity as chief of doctrine for peacekeeping operation at the un have deal with the issue of protect civilian we find that violence against civilian take place in very specific context especially when weapon be plentiful and there be no command structure the fact that socialist newspaper print such statement unquestioningly even tend to agree be scandal in itself in other part of the article which be not adopt by the sco baud discuss the russian military strategy and judge it to be largely successful he even believe that the demilitarization of ukraine desire by putin have almost be achieve and that the ukrainian army in the east of the country be almost encircled fortunately the soz do not accept the embarrassment of this putin friendly misjudgment which however reveal the instrumental selection of the text fragment by the soz editor all the more clearly jacques baud otherwise publish on website in the orbit of those who downplay the pandemic and in conservative to reactionary magazine with clear inclination to defend the russian regime jacques baud have also make name for himself as supporter of bashar al assad's syrian regime he deny assad's crime and deny the high death toll in darfur critic accuse he of spread conspiracy story 10 jacque baud work manipulatively and do not shy away from falsify the statement of the cite source 11 an example baud write in the soz however let we remember that before february 23 24 2022 there be never russian troop in donbass osce observer have never see even the slight trace of russian unit in donbass baud also deny that donbass rebel receive russian weapon in 2014 baud rely on osce representative alexander hug in another article in the quote interview however he say the opposite of baud's assertion 12 the shooting down of the malaysia airlines passenger plane in july 2014 be also worth remember the dutch investigation unequivocally establish the presence of russian war material on the territory of ukraine second example baud write on march 24 2021 volodymyr zelenskyi issue decree to recapture crimea and begin move his force to the south of the country zelenskyi do indeed issue decree on march 24 2021 to deoccupation and restoration of ukrainian sovereignty over crimea the decision complain about the systematic violation of human right especially of the traditional tatar population it emphasize range of diplomatic political economic legal cultural and humanitarian measure to achieve this goal prioritize they over military mean to interpret this decree as preparation for the military expulsion of the russian occupy force be plain falsification 13 short research would have dhe soz editor actually have to be careful on the contrary the editor justify their choice in the introduction to baud's article as follow we be unable to verify the accuracy of the fact present there however we consider his description to be conclusive in itself nor do we adopt every one of his judgment as our own but when he write in reality we be not try to help ukraine we be try to fight russia this also correspond to our impression the text may therefore be read as piece of necessary counter enlightenment so the soz name simple manipulation and falsification as counter enlightenment actually this only allow one conclusion the soz editor say that the ukrainian resistance to russia be reprehensible this justification in full awareness of the author's political position and in the context of the long term plan russian war of aggression be nothing less than an editorial declaration of bankruptcy at the same time it be political justification for pro putin propaganda and place it on an equal footing with socialist criticism of russian imperialism in other soz article ultimately with the publication of this article the soz editorial team decide to spread clumsy and most perfidious propaganda for the putin regime incidentally in the introduction to baud's article the soz editorial team also say that the fake environmental foundation set up by spd leader in mecklenburg western pomerania to organize gas trade with russia be close in the course of the anti russian propaganda wave that be unleash instead of take up the climate movement's justified criticism of this gas trade and its environmental policy camouflage the soz editorial team present the closure of the foundation as an act hostile to russia lie than many leave steinmei panegyric on the same double page the soz publish an article by roland czada professor of politic and public administration 14 the editorial round off the obvious political message the author complain that the ukrainian government do not invite president steinmeier and attribute this diplomatic affront to steinmei's role in the negotiation for the implementation of the two minsk agreement the author draw incomprehensible and questionable historical comparison for example with the peace of westphalia and its criticism by the nazi apart from that he know for sure that steinmeier's recipe would have be good for ukraine the goal of neutral federally structured ukraine would have correspond well to its history and conflict situation than unitary state especially since the vast majority of the population live in the east and south long reject the country's western orientation ukraine and conceal the fact that since 2014 russia have openly question ukraine's sovereignty border and even its very existence in blunt neocolonial manner the author write in my opinion the minsk agreement and the steinmei formula could have solve the conflict and restore the eastern border of ukraine the minsk agreement have be openly undermine by ukrainian nationalist the west should have put pressure on ukraine to implement the agreement this article also aim to portray the ukrainian government as hostage to right wing extremist portray it as partly responsible for the russian war of aggression and thus make the ukrainian resistance appear illegitimate to let actually the publication of these article and their editorial accompaniment do not allow any other conclusion than that the soz editorial

890,we will not cede southern ukraine to russia thus zelensky yesterday place tombstone on the possibility of start negotiation with the russians shortly in this way he want to respond publicly and unequivocally to the request of macron and scholz who during their visit to kiev together with draghi have ask he to resume negotiation nothing in fact the president who flaunt the army green shirt in all circumstance can not distance himself from america which do not allow he alternative to war to strengthen zelensky's relaunch the parallel declaration of nato secretary general jens stoltenberg who affirm that the war could last year if in recent day the peace party have have jolt in the west open glimmer it can be note with certain sadness that this hint of vitality be promptly silence on the other hand it be also quite evident in the report of the journey of hope to use term use in religious pilgrimage by scholz and macron the few important medium have report on the request make by the leader and those who report it do so with the distraction of the case limit himself to reiterate the mantra of ukraine's entry into the eu we take the definition peace party from steven erlanger times reporter and pulitzer prize winner who when ask by yana dlugy for the new york times say that over ukraine in the west there be conflict between the party of peace and the party of justice the justice party explain erlanger basically make up of eastern europe the baltic state and great britain and the usa of course believe that there be something more at stake than ukraine which be european security theme and that if putin do not feel defeat if he do not stop there then somehow he will continue in his assertiveness the peace party fear that the objective of the justice party be the extension of the war to the point of risk an escalation to the involvement of nato country in the war with the aim of corner putin there be some truth in these line but the final consideration be even more correct namely that if america no long support ukraine the war would end quickly if not immediately the cessation of hostility would not so much see moscow invade kiev move that would threaten the case only to weaken the hand of the adversary but the ukrainian leadership would immediately open up to negotiation which the russians would welcome be able to declare the war over kiev proclaim victory in reality the ongoing clash be not only between an asserted justice and an irenic peace but above all between foreign policy mark by realism and that dominant in america and alternatively because it be subordinate in europe forge by hyper liberal and or neo conservative ideology this clash be describe very well in an article by sumantra maitra in the national interest to which we refer

their abstract universal formulation but that they must be filter through the concrete circumstance of time and place the individual can say fiat iustitia pereat mundus let justice be do even if the world perishe but the state do not have the right to say it in the name of those under its guardianship both the individual and the state must judge political action on the basis of universal moral principle such as that of liberty however while the individual have the moral right to sacrifice himself in defense of such moral principle the state have no right to let its moral disapproval of the infringement of liberty stand in the way of successful political action itself inspire by the moral principle of national survival there can be no political morality without prudence that be without

891,we will not cede southern ukraine to russia thus zelensky yesterday place tombstone on the possibility of start negotiation with the russians shortly in this way he want to respond publicly and unequivocally to the request of macron and scholz who during their visit to kiev together with draghi have ask he to resume negotiation nothing in fact the president who flaunt the army green shirt in all circumstance can not distance himself from america which do not allow he alternative to war to strengthen zelensky's relaunch the parallel declaration of nato secretary general jens stoltenberg who affirm that the war could last year if in recent day the peace party have have jolt in the west open glimmer it can be note with certain sadness that this hint of vitality be promptly silence on the other hand it be also quite evident in the report of the journey of hope to use term use in religious pilgrimage by scholz and macron very few important medium have report on the request make by the leader and those who report it do so with the distraction of the case limit himself to reiterate the mantra of ukraine's entry into the eu we take the definition peace party from steven erlanger times reporter and pulitzer prize winner who when ask by yana dlugy for the new york times say that over ukraine in the west there be conflict between the party of peace and the party of justice the justice party explain erlanger basically make up of eastern europe the baltic state and great britain and the usa of course believe that there be something more at stake than ukraine which be the security theme and that if putin do not feel defeat if he do not stand there then somehow he will continue in his assertiveness the peace party fear that the objective of the justice party be the extension of the war to the point of risk an escalation to the involvement of nato country in the war with the aim of corner putin there be some truth in these line but the final consideration be even more correct namely that if america no long support ukraine the war would end quickly if not immediately the cessation of hostility would not so much see moscow invade kiev move that would threaten the case only to force the hand of the adversary but the ukrainian leadership would immediately open up to negotiation which the russians would welcome be able to declare the war over and proclaim victory in moscow the ongoing clash be not only between an asserted justice and an irenic peace but above all between foreign policy mark by realism and that dominant in america and alternatively because it be subordinate in europe forge by hyper liberal and or neo conservative ideology this clash be describe very well in an article by sumantra maitra in the national interest to which we refer

final certification gas delivery will begin german homeowner and business will have reliable source of clean and affordable energy while russia will see its gas revenue increase significantly it be win win situation for both party the us foreign policy establishment be not satisfied with this development they do not want germany to become ever more dependent on russian gas because trade build trust and trust lead to expand trade as relation heat up trade barrier be eliminate regulation be relaxed travel and tourism be ramp up and new security architecture be put in place in world where germany and russia be friend and trading partner there be no long need for us military basis expensive we make missile and weapon system or nato nor be it necessary to transact energy in we dollar or store we treasury to balance account transaction between trading partner can be do in their own currency which be bind to precipitate sharp drop in the value of the dollar and dramatic shift in economic power this be why the biden administration oppose nord stream this be not just pipeline but window into the future future in which europe and asia unite in vast free trade area that enhance their mutual power and prosperity while leave the united states on the sideline the consolidation of relation between germany and russia herald the end of the unipolar world order that the united states have be vigilant for the past 75 year german russian alliance risk precipitate the decline of the superpower that be near the brink this be why washington be determined to do everything possible to sabotage nord stream and keep germany in its orbit it be matter of survival will be where ukraine come into play ukraine be washington's weapon of choice to torpedo nord stream and drive wedge between germany and russia the strategy be take from the first page of the us foreign policy handbook under the heading divide and conquer washington must give the impression that russia pose threat to european security this be the goal they must prove that putin be bloodthirsty capricious and unreliable aggressor to so end the medium have be instruct to obsessively repeat over and over again that russia plan to invade ukraine what be but unsaid be that russia have not invade any country since the dissolution of the soviet union that the united states have invade or overthrow regime in more than 50 country in the same period and that the united states maintain more than 800 military basis in worldwide none of this be report by the medium indeed the focus be on the evil putin who have gather about 100, 000 soldier along the ukrainian border threaten to plunge all of europe into new bloody war all this hysterical war propaganda be create with the intention of produce crisis which can be use to isolate demonize and ultimately divide russia into small territorial unit the real target however be not russia but germany check out this excerpt below from an article by michael hudson in the unz review the only way leave for american diplomat to block european purchase be to push russia into military response and then pretend that revenge for that response trump any purely national economic interest as under secretary of state for political affair victoria nuland explain during state department press conference on jan 27 if russia invade ukraine one way or another nord stream will not advance it be write in black and white biden's team want to push russia into military response to sabotage nord stream this imply there will be some sort of provocation intend to get putin to send his troop across the border to defend ethnic russians in the east of the country if putin take the bait the response will be swift and severe the medium will denounce this action as threat to all of europe while world leader will denounce putin as the new hitlerer that be washington's strategy in nutshell and all of this staging be orchestrate for one purpose to make it politically impossible for german chancellor olaf scholz to get nord stream through the final approval process give what we know of washington's opposition to nord stream reader may wonder why early this year the biden administration lobby congress not to impose further sanction on the project the answer to this question be simple internal politic germany be in the process of decommission its nuclear power plant and need natural gas to fill its energy deficit furthermore the threat of economic sanction be foil for germans who see it as sign of foreign meddling why be the united states interfere in our energy decision ask the middle german washington should mind its own business and not meddle in ours then there be this statement from al jazeera most germans support the project only part of the elite and the medium be against the pipeline the more the us talk about sanction or criticize the project the more popular it become in german society say stefan meister an expert on russia and eastern europe at the german council on foreign relation public opinion therefore strongly support nord stream which help explain why washington have opt for new approach with sanction not work uncle sam move on to plan create an external threat big enough to force germany to block the pipeline from open frankly this strategy smack of desperation but one must be impress by washington's persistence they may be down point down the stretch but they have not throw in the towel yet they will give themselves one last chance and see if they can make progress on monday president biden hold his first joint press conference with german chancellor olaf scholz at the white house the hype that surround this event be simply unmatched it be all orchestrate to create an atmosphere of crisis which biden use to pressure the chancellor in the direction of us policy early in the week white house spokeswoman jen psaki repeatedly say that the russian invasion be imminent his comment be follow up by state department spokesman nick price who say intelligence agency have give he detail of russian back false flag operation that be expect to take place soon accord to the united states in eastern ukraine the warning of mr price be follow sunday morning by national security adviser jake sullivan who say russian invasion could happen at any time possibly even tomorrow this be only few day after the bloomberg news agency publish its sensational and totally false headline russia invade ukraine can you see the pattern here can you see how these baseless claim be all use to put pressure on the german chancellor who be oblivious and seem unaware of the campaign target he as one might expect the coup de grace be deliver by the american president himself during the press conference biden forcefully state that if russia invade there will be no more de nord stream we will put an end to this so now washington decide germany's policy what insufferable arrogance the german chancellor be stun by biden's comment which be clearly not part of the original script despite this scholz have never agree to cancel nord stream and have even refuse to mention the pipeline by name if biden think he could force the leader of the world's third large economy to corner he in public forum he be wrong germany remain committed to launch nord stream regardless of potential tension in distant ukraine but that could change at any time after all who know what incentive washington might prepare in the near future who know how many life they be willing to sacrifice to drive wedge between germany and russia who know what risk biden be willing to take to slow the decline of the united states and prevent the emergence of new polycentric world order anything can happen in the week to come all for now germany be in strong position it be up to scholz to decide how to solve the case will he implement the policy that well serve the interest of the german people or will he give in to biden's relentless pressure it will draw new coursewhich will strengthen new alliance in the seethe eurasian corridor or support washington's savage geopolitical ambition will it accept germany's central role in new world order in which many emerge power center equally share global governance and leader will remain unswervingly committed to multilateralism that be the question one thing be certain whatever germany decide it will affect all of wethe crisis in ukraine be not about ukraine this concern germany",0

administration lobby congress not to impose further sanction on the project the answer to this question be simple internal politic germany be in the process of decommission its nuclear power plant and need natural gas to fill its energy deficit furthermore the threat of economic sanction be foil for germans who see it as sign of foreign meddling why be the united states interfere in our energy decision ask the middle german washington should mind its own business and not meddle in ours then there be this statement from al jazeera most germans support the project only part of the elite and the medium be against the pipeline the more the us talk about sanction or criticize the project the more popular it become in german society say stefan meister an expert on russia and eastern europe at the german council on foreign relation public opinion therefore strongly support nord stream which help explain why washington have opt for new approach with sanction not work uncle sam move on to plan create an external threat big enough to force germany to block the pipeline from open frankly this strategy smack of desperation but one must be impress by washington's persistence they may be down point down the stretch but they have not throw in the towel yet they will give themselves one last chance and see if they can make progress on monday president biden hold his first joint press conference with german chancellor olaf scholz at the white house the hype that surround this event be simply unmatched it be all orchestrate to create an atmosphere of crisis which biden use to pressure the chancellor in the direction of us policy early in the week white house spokeswoman jen psaki repeatedly say that the russian invasion be imminent his comment be follow up by state department spokesman nick price who say intelligence agency have give he detail of russian back false flag operation that be expect to take place soon accord to the united states in eastern ukraine the warning of mr price be follow sunday morning by national security adviser jake sullivan who say russian invasion could happen at any time possibly even tomorrow this be only few day after the bloomberg news agency publish its sensational and totally false headline russia invade ukraine can you see the pattern here can you see how these baseless claim be all use to put pressure on the german chancellor who be oblivious and seem unaware of the campaign target he as one might expect the coup de grace be deliver by the american president himself during the press conference biden forcefully state that if russia invade there will be no more de nord stream we will put an end to this so now washington decide germany's policy what insufferable arrogance the german chancellor be stun by biden's comment which be clearly not part of the original script despite this scholz have never agree to cancel nord stream and have even refuse to mention the pipeline by name if biden think he could force the leader of the world's third large economy to corner he in public forum he be wrong germany remain committed to launch nord stream regardless of potential tension in distant ukraine but that could change at any time after all who know what incentive washington might prepare in the near future who know how many life they be willing to sacrifice to drive wedge between germany and russia who know what risk biden be willing to take to slow the decline of the united states and prevent the emergence of new polycentric world order anything can happen in the week to come all for now germany be in strong position it be up to scholz to decide how to solve the case will he implement the policy that well serve the interest of the german people or will he give in to biden's relentless pressure it will draw new coursewhich will strengthen new alliance in the seethe eurasian corridor or support washington's savage geopolitical ambition will it accept germany's central role in new world order in which many emerge power center equally share global governance and leader will remain unswervingly committed to multilateralism that be the question one thing be certain whatever germany decide it will affect all of wethe crisis in ukraine be not about ukraine this concern germany",0

playing the role of silvio berlusconi and the socialist anne hidalgo in those of the more leftist left that be pier luigi bersani roberto speranza nicola fratoianni in addition but very lateral the other defeat french candidate who in italy could be embody by matteo renzi carlo calenda and centrist of various order and rank naturally we have to play as if we be in semi presidential system precisely in the french style in which the president or the republic be elect by the people and be essentially the head of the government with two round electoral law which provide for run off between the first two arrival the other have to make do with small right to the rostrum and electoral reimbursement should they exceed percent of the vote on the basis of the poll available to we letta and meloni should go to the ballot direct challenge between right and leave that recall those between prodi and berlusconi in 1996 and 2006 in this case however there would be no coalition of five six seven or even nine party to support the two candidate with consequent and legitimate claim from ministry and undersecretariat cross blackmail and little cabotage game but at most explanation of vote for one or the other exactly as be happen in france these day then after the result it will be up to whoever win to open or not his government to some representative of the minor force who have invite their elector to vote for he or she in any case the victor will have lot of power just enough to allow he to govern for the entire legislature so let us see how all the athlete on the pitch could play the game the two protagonist will try to acquire the vote available on the square letta will have the most difficult task have to turn to both the left and the center or will have to try to propose program that can convince conte bersani fratoianni renzi and calenda and not the it will be enough to appeal to sort of popular front against the right instead it will have to make an effort to explain to voter what it intend to do on all the issue on the agenda of country that will not have emerge from the economic crisis cause by the pandemic and then by the war in ukraine put simply he will have to expose himself on taxis that be who have to pay more and who less on the recipient of the few available resource on civil right on immigrant and so on it will not be easy for he to convince the leader and voter who be so different and very often at odd with each other to vote for he especially the grillini and the left wing radical who do not like euphemism the renzians and the calendians and viceversa for meloni the game seem simple after all the value let us call they that of the italian right be very similar if not the same what would be the difference between the brother of italy and the league very few so it be very likely that salvini's voter would vote convinced and en masse for giorgia meloni the situation for those who still identify with forza italia be slightly different although the fear of the left of the communist the cavaliere would say may also apply to they some would not feel at ease with sovereign and substantially anti european president for more escort by salvini as well as the same voter of renzi and calenda who would hardly vote for meloni at the quirinale while among the cinquestelle where we find people who come from the left together with other who have history and culture that have nothing to do with the left there could be someone who can give his vote to meloni perhaps recall the good time of the alliance with the sovereignist salvini so long live the french system that would allow we to have president elect directly by the people who could govern in peace for five year without obstacle blackmail and veto right of the party

that consensus be now be build and return posing in front of the repaired turbine of the nord stream gas pipeline understand this on wednesday german chancellor olaf scholz have his photo take in front of one of the turbine of the nord stream gas pipeline currently store at the siemens energy headquarters at mulheim an der ruhr since the beginning of the conflict in ukraine the pipeline have be at the center of controversy german and european dependence on russian gas be one of the main weapon of blackmail in the hand of the kremlin to discourage the german and eu response to the invasion before the conflict 45 of germany's gas import come from russia it be fundamental source of energy for the country's need both for its industrial production and in the aftermath of the energiewende the energy turnaround which plan to gradually abandon nuclear and fossil source to invest in renewable one with gas as an intermediate measure crucial in this process follow the russian invasion germany join the european sanction also block the activation of nord stream the doubling of the already exist gas pipeline that have be much debate at european and global level for year the work be now complete but the scholz government prevent it from be put into operation berlin have also diversify its gas supply the share of that come from russia have be reduce to 35 but it be unlikely to be able to do without it completely before 2024 with the prolongation and intensification of the sanction in recent week moscow have unilaterally decrease the flow of gas to europe currently supply volume be around 40 of pre conflict level to justify the reduction the kremlin speak of technical problem with the pipeline's turbine one of these be fly to canada for repair but be then detain due to sanction robert habeck german minister of economy and climate protection have ask canada to send the turbine to germany in order to then be able to ship it in turn to russia but at that point moscow raise bureaucratic problem for the shipment scholz therefore last wednesday pose in front of the turbine declare to the press that the turbine work and that everything be quite clear and simple the turbine be there and it can be deliver but someone have to say clearly that they want it clear reference to moscow scholz's move be part of the widespread skepticism at european level about the russian version regard the interruption of the service but it also respond to deeply feel need from germany precisely because of its energy dependence on russia in fact the government have have to take emergency decision which in several case also contradict the direction that the government have announce it would take in the phase of its establishment this have concern in particular the two main government force the social democrats who represent the chancellor and the green who have two key ministry in this phase that of the economy in the hand of robert habeck and that of foreign affair lead by annalena baerbock if the delay in send arm to ukraine have cause various criticism of scholz and the spd on the energy front as it be easy to imagine it be the grune who be under observation for gas supply for example germany have discuss with qatar to which the green have long harbor skepticism furthermore in june habeck launch plan to restart some coal fire plant to make up for the reduced gas supply the decision obviously be the result of contingency but it be singular that green minister find himself have to take it especially if we consider that his party have be central in anticipate the exit from this fossil source move it from 2040 to 2030 furthermore yesterday scholz declare that germany could think about prolong the activity of nuclear power plant currently in fact the country be in the terminal phase of long and gradual process of give up nuclear energy one of the main political battle of the green accord to plan 2022 should be the last year of activity of the only three nuclear power plant still in operation but in the past there have be speculation to extend their activity and postpone the definitive shutdown however useful the measure if validate could still largely respond to the need to give signal to both russia and german public opinion beyond its actual usefulness indeed there be number of element to consider the tthree active power plant for example produce of the energy use in germany against the 25 generate by seventeen active reactor before the nuclear withdrawal plan certainly not an irrelevant share but not decisive one either furthermore prolong the activity of the plant would mean produce less energy than expect accord to government report date back to march when the activity of reactor slowly begin to terminate due to the lack of unused uranium at the end of its useful life the production can be artificially extend for few month by plant control measure but at the cost of low efficiency for this reason the report advise against an extension of the period of activity similarly real suspension of the nuclear exit plan would be complex not only due to the technical and bureaucratic time that this would require but also due to the fact that the uranium supply could still lead berlin to look to moscow furthermore scholz's declaration could also respond to the logic of show himself pragmatic and reactive at time when he and his party be fall in the approval poll and be suffer greatly from the growth of the cdu and the high appreciation for habeck and baerbock who have always be oppose to an extension on nuclear power and have only recently become more optimistic in fact public opinion seem to be in favor of the measure at the end of june 61 of respondent to survey by infratest dimap believe it be right to continue the activity of the plant still operational beyond 2022 accord to forsa survey of the past few day today the percentage would have rise to 75 fairly distribute judgment among the various electorate and which concern more than one person out of two even among those who vote green in the last election the energy issue therefore be central not only for the german economy and for european freedom of action vis vis moscow but be increasingly topic for build political consensus in germany how long this phase will last will depend on series of factor first of all

eudravigilance record almost million adverse reaction more than double the previous year it be not the first time that we have try to delve into the database offer by the body which for transparency should also monitor the adverse reaction cause by take medicine and vaccine exactly one year ago more precisely on july 23 2021 we publish an article highlight the almost 19, 000 death record by eudravigilance follow the intake of covid vaccine out of total of over 700, 000 report of adverse reaction just the next day we immediately publish an update as the death of only one week declare by the official site highlight 862 since then what have change other than the addition of the fifth novavax vaccine the number be there all to be read in their raw reality eudravigilance maintain indicative datum for the last year and to ensure we have download the following spreadsheet format from the database covid 19 mrna vaccine modern cx 024414 312. 013 covid 19 mrna vaccine pfizer biontech tozinameran 1. 043 308 covid 19 vaccine astrazeneca chadox ncov 19 506, 221 covid 19 vaccine janssen ad26 cov 65, 669 covid 19 vaccine novavax nvx cov 2373 1, 117 for total of 1, 928 328 report of adverse reaction to list vaccine these be the datum update to july 2022 that anyone can read on the eudravigilance website which we remember be the centralized european database of suspect adverse reaction to medicine authorize or under study in clinical trial in the european economic area the number speak for themselves from july 2021 to july 2022 those who suffer an adverse reaction to vaccine feed pool of patient enough to see the number more than double compare to the previous year how many death be there if from july 2020 to today we can roughly count over 2. 6 million adverse reaction if official death year ago amount to 19 thousand how many be there today in october 2021 another update be put online and speak of 27, 242 death across europe an increase of 44 in just over two month and italy be between fourth and eighth only second if we count report of reaction to the more recent novavax face with these number we wonder why there be so much silence especially from the press but also from good part of the scientific and medical community it seem more than clear that the vaccination campaign conduct so far have show numerous shortcoming give that the number of infect people mostly vaccinate in the third dose be becoming infect again the search on eudravigilance have also highlight numerous case of death include for minor clearly protect by privacy by follow the instruction that we have already provide through the news of year ago it be possible to get to the file of the individual case child in the 3 / 11 age range but also death of newborn child who have suffer the effect of vaccination for maternal fetal transmission and we be talk about case date back to may 17 and june 30 2022 the vaccine also for obvious issue of diffusion which have cause the most damage be always the pfizer vaccine the table available to eudravigilance also highlight this datum the major case be collect in the general disorder and administration site condition class of disorder that include condition of general type that derive from disease from the treatment of disease or from the administration of treatment in particular site and manif with characteristic set of symptom and sign of these about 40 be classify as serious and it be here that the great death be also record and only for this reaction group for the pfize vacciner we stop in our analysis not for lack of will but simply because we would like those datum to be read directly from the source by anyone who do not want to turn their head away because they be not directly affect by the tragedy of serious adverse reaction or death certainly the word of minister speranza make we think who just today speak at the twelfth congress of uil pensionati and immediately after learn of the go ahead from ecdc and ema declare woe to think that the battle against covid be win it be still in progress and we must maintain level of attention and prudence we wonder where the prudence be in the face of the above datum and the continuous news of infection with variant that from time to time be declare less virulent than the previous oneema and ecdc say yes for the 4th dose meanwhile million report of vaccine damage in the last year alone",1

934,the subdued reaction of the serbian authority to the escalation of the armed conflict between russia and ukraine visible in recent week show that the decision maker in belgrade be try to maintain neutral position towards the event in eastern europe public medium in serbia report on the russian ukrainian conflict in similar way in turn the information message present by serbian tabloid remain clearly selective and more or less pro russian interpretation and narrative of the current war that be favorable to russia mean that the content present in the mass medium in serbia be at least partially different from what they publish by the medium of most european country which openly point to the unprovoked aggressive and illegal nature of russia's action against ukraine retract and neutral position of the serbian authority towards the conflict between russia and ukraine serbia's position on the russian ukrainian war differ from that of the eu country which openly condemn russia's action and decide to introduce multidimensional sanction against the russian federation the reaction of the serbian authority to the escalation of the crisis and russia's final aggression against ukraine visible in recent week show that the authority in belgrade be try to maintain neutral position towards the event in the east and be strive to maintain good relation with both the attack ukraine and russia which be the obvious aggressor this lead to the conclusion that the neutrality declare by serbia be in practice ambiguous have pejorative connotation and in some aspect mean de facto status and actual support for russia see ies commentary no 556 public medium in serbia center message the serbian policy of neutrality with regard to event in the east be reflect in the analysis of the information message present by public broadcaster this message can be consider descriptive balanced factual more or less symmetrical and in specific way neutral present the position of both side but devoid of an in depth discourse on the obvious unlawful nature of russian aggression and war crime of the russian army in ukraine this assessment be confirm by the analysis of medium content for the period from february 15 to march 2022 prepare by the regulatory authority for electronic medium regulatorno telo za electronske medije rem it show that the russian ukrainian war be currently the most important topic present on rt accord to rem the content present by public broadcaster rt rt rtv and rtv in the analyze period include information on the war in the east be mostly neutral between 66. 02 and 81. 42 of the total medium coverage be consider neutral serbian tabloid proudly side with russia an analysis of the content of the serbian medium over the last three week show that the popular private media tabloid which shape the information message reach many inhabitant of serbia present content that can be consider highly selective conducive to russian narrative or openly pro russian thus when report on the event in ukraine serbian tabloid often present manipulated and untrue and sometimes also obviously absurd statement from the russian side on armed conflict provoke by nato the defensive nature of russia's action draw into the war by the west the geopolitical context of event in the east russia's legitimate support for the threatened donbas the popularity of far right and extremist attitude on the ukrainian side persecution of russians by the authority in kiev biological weapon in ukraine barbaric behavior of the ukrainian army etc putin's statement question the statehood of ukraine be also quote many of these type of article be in fact substantive and linguistic carbon copy neo nazis neo fascists nato threat warmonger regime in ukraine special military operation of the prepared information message offer by the russian medium the actual or allege military success of the russian army be also praise the russians occupy ukraine in one day the russians reach kiev in one day the russians break through the front near gorlovka this be key victory for putin army the informer daily probably go the furth with the headline ukraine attack russia on the cover of february 22 2022 the whole one sided picture be complement by carefully select photo of president putin suggest that he be strong and prudent leader effectively oppose the confrontational policy of the west although the popular serbian medium report the event in the east in an unbiased way in fact as marija vucic point out they do so in balanced way and do not escalate the pro russian narrative beyond measure and this self limitation do not seemaccidental think the tabloid be still chain up though know very well what tabloid messaging can be like when they have no self control these text be somewhat polished certainly however they do not conform to journalistic standard however serbian tabloid clearly avoid publish information on the defeat and loss of the russian army and war crime commit by the russians in ukraine two track information policy per facta concludentia characteristic element of the serbian medium space be also the inconsistent and in the opinion of zeljko bodrozic de facto schizophrenic information message on the one hand in the serbian medium the narration of the authority in belgrade be withdraw and neutral in principle which mutatis mutandi reflect the pro western and european vector in serbia's foreign policy this narrative at least partly correspond to the expectation of the anti war coalition of western country who expect that serbia which be candidate for eu accession will present position consistent with that of eu country on key international issue on the other hand pro government tabloid which in the opinion of critic publish an information message that meet the current need of serbian decision maker present narrative favorable to the russian side in line with the perspective of large part of serbian society and the

935,the subdued reaction of the serbian authority to the escalation of the armed conflict between russia and ukraine visible in recent week show that the decision maker in belgrade be try to maintain neutral position towards the event in eastern europe public medium in serbia report on the russian ukrainian conflict in similar way in turn the information message present by serbian tabloid remain clearly selective and more or less pro russian interpretation and narrative of the current war that be favorable to russia mean that the content present in the mass medium in serbia be at least partially different from what be publish by the medium of most european country which openly point to the unprovoked aggressive and illegal nature of russia's action against ukraine retract and neutral position of the serbian authority towards the conflict between russia and ukraine serbia's position on the russian ukrainian war differ from that of the eu country which openly condemn russia's action and decide to introduce multidimensional sanction against the russian federation the reaction of the serbian authority to the escalation of the crisis and russia's final aggression against ukraine visible in recent week show that the authority in belgrade be try that maintain neutral position towards the event in the east and be strive to maintain good relation with both the attack ukraine and russia which be the obvious aggressor this lead to the conclusion that the neutrality declare by serbia be in practice ambiguous have pejorative connotation and in some aspect mean de facto symbolic and actual support for russia see ies commentary no 556 public medium in serbia center message the serbian policy of neutrality with regard to event in the east be reflect in the content of the information message present by public broadcaster this message can be consider descriptive balanced factual more or less symmetrical and in specific way neutral present the position against both side but devoid of an in depth discourse on the obvious unlawful nature of russian aggression and war crime of the russian army in ukraine this assessment be confirm by the analysis of medium content for the period from february 15 to march 2022 prepare by the regulatory authority for electronic medium regulatorno telo za electronske medije rem it show that the russian ukrainian war be currently the most important topic present on rt accord to rem the content present by public broadcaster rt rt rtv and rtv in the analyze period include information on the war in the east be mostly neutral between 66. 02 and 81. 42 of the total medium coverage be consider neutral serbian tabloid proudly side with russia an analysis of relevant content of the serbian medium over the last three week show that the popular private media tabloid which shape the information message reach many inhabitant of serbia present content that can be consider highly selective conducive to russian narrative or openly pro russian thus when report on the event in ukraine serbian tabloid often present manipulated and untrue and sometimes also obviously absurd statement from the russian side on armed conflict provoke by nato the defensive nature of russia's action draw into the war by the west the geopolitical context of event in the east russia's legitimate support for the threatened donbas the popularity of far right and extremist attitude on the ukrainian side persecution of russians by the authority in kiev biological weapon in ukraine barbaric behavior of the ukrainian army etc putin's statement question the statehood of ukraine be also quote many of these type of article be in fact substantive and linguistic carbon copy neo nazis neo fascists nato threat warmonger regime in ukraine special military operation of the prepared information message offer by the russian medium the actual or allege military success of the russian army be also praise the russians occupy ukraine in one day the russians reach kiev in one day the russians break through the front near gorlovka this be key victory for putin army the informer daily probably go the furth with the headline ukraine attack russia on the cover of february 22 2022 the whole one sided picture be complement by carefully select photo of president putin suggest that he be strong and prudent leader effectively oppose the confrontational policy of the west although the popular serbian medium report the event in the east in an unbiased way in fact as marija vucic point out they do so in balanced way and do not escalate the pro russian narrative beyond measure and this self limitation do not seemaccidental think the tabloid be still chain up though know very well what tabloid messaging can be like when they have no self control these text be somewhat polished certainly however they do not conform to journalistic standard however serbian tabloid clearly avoid publish information on the defeat and loss of the russian army and war crime commit by the russians in ukraine two track information policy per facta concludentia characteristic element of the serbian medium space be also the inconsistent and in the opinion of zeljko bodrozic de facto schizophrenic information message on the one hand in the serbian medium the narration of the authority in belgrade be withdraw and neutral in principle which mutatis mutandi reflect the pro western and european vector in serbia's foreign policy this narrative at least partly correspond to the expectation of the anti war coalition of western country who expect that serbia which be candidate for eu accession will present position consistent with that of eu country on key international issue on the other hand pro government tabloid which in the opinion of critic publish an information message that meet the current need of serbian decision maker present narrative favorable to the russian side in line with the perspective of large part of serbian society and the expectation of politician in the kremlin this be because as nemanja rujevic state serbian president aleksandar vucic be too experienced politician to make elementary mistake in foreign policy and he leave his enthusiasm for russian military action to the tabloids it also seem that the pro russian information message control by the authority in belgrade and promote by some medium be
