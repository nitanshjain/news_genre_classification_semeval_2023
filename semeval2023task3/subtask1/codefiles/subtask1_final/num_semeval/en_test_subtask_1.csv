0,3121,"The Pope Says 'Humanity Must Repent For Abusing Mother Earth'
","We humans “must repent and modify our lifestyles” because of our abuse of Mother Earth, Pope Francis states in a message released Thursday.
In his Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation, the pontiff decries the “mistreatment” of our common home stemming from “our consumerist excesses,” “tyrannical anthropocentrism,” “predatory economic interests,” and “short sighted and selfish actions” leading to “the collapse of our planet’s ecosystems.”
“In the first place, it is our sister, mother earth, who cries out. Prey to our consumerist excesses, she weeps and implores us to put an end to our abuses and to her destruction,” Francis declares in his Message.
Because of human irresponsibility “countless species are dying out and their hymns of praise silenced,” the pope laments, while the ancestral lands of indigenous peoples “are being invaded and devastated on all sides, ‘provoking a cry that rises up to heaven.’”
Because of the “climate crisis,” the poor disproportionately suffer the impact of “the drought, flooding, hurricanes and heat waves that are becoming ever more intense and frequent,” the pope asserts.
“Listening to these anguished cries, we must repent and modify our lifestyles and destructive systems,” Francis proposes, since the “present state of decay of our common home merits the same attention as other global challenges such as grave health crises and wars.”
The ecological conversion needed to bring about lasting change cannot simply take place at the individual level, the pope insists, but must be “also a community conversion” embracing multilateral solutions, “especially in the meetings of the United Nations devoted to the environmental question.”
In his Message, Francis also plugs the COP27 conference on climate change, to be held in Egypt in November 2022, which “represents the next opportunity for all to join in promoting the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.”
The Holy See subscribes to the Paris goal of limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C, Francis states, which “calls for responsible cooperation between all nations in presenting climate plans or more ambitious nationally determined contributions in order to reduce to zero, as quickly as possible, net greenhouse gas emissions.”
“This means ‘converting’ models of consumption and production, as well as lifestyles, in a way more respectful of creation and the integral human development of all peoples, present and future,” he adds. “The transition brought about by this conversion cannot neglect the demands of justice, especially for those workers who are most affected by the impact of climate change.”
Along with the UN climate conference, Francis underscores the importance of a UN summit on biodiversity, to be held in Canada in December, as a way to address “the double crisis of climate change and the reduction of biodiversity.”
The summit “will offer to the goodwill of governments a significant opportunity to adopt a new multilateral agreement to halt the destruction of ecosystems and the extinction of species,” he states.
The pontiff goes on to insist that wealthy nations have an “ecological debt” to poorer nations and must subsidize their transition to sustainable energy in reparation for their excesses.
“How can we fail to acknowledge the existence of an ‘ecological debt’ incurred by the economically richer countries, who have polluted most in the last two centuries; this demands that they take more ambitious steps at COP27 and at COP15,” he declares.
This debt also means “keeping their promises of financial and technical support for the economically poorer nations, which are already experiencing most of the burden of the climate crisis,” he proposes.
“In the name of God, I ask the great extractive industries – mining, oil, forestry, real estate, agribusiness – to stop destroying forests, wetlands, and mountains, to stop polluting rivers and seas, to stop poisoning food and people.”
“It is necessary for all of us to act decisively. For we are reaching ‘a breaking point,’” he states.
As you can see the Pope is now a proponent of Gaia, aka “Mother Earth”… No he is not saying Humanity should repent for straying away from God, no, now humanity should apologize to Gaia! This personification of the Earth is pagan in origin and as you can see the Pope is anything BUT Christian.

1,3135,"Russian allies are unknowingly working against them to help Ukraine
","The Secretary of State for Defence described Putin as dangerous but said that he was unlikely to use tactical nuclear weapons, despite the Russian president's threats.
Ben Wallace says 'Russia is yet to achieve any of its objectives'
Ben Wallace today gave a damning assessment of Vladimir Putin and said that Russia would be deeply unhappy to find out which countries were secretly helping Ukraine. Speaking on the first day of the Conservative Party Conference, the secretary of state for defence described how Russia's actions had prompted an unprecedented level of co-operation from countries across the world including states with a long term commitment to neutrality or a generally pro-Moscow position.
Ben Wallace spoke about Putin at the Tory Party Conference today Ben Wallace spoke about Putin at the Tory Party Conference today
""There are a number of countries who do help secretly,"" Mr Wallace said. ""(Russia) would be deeply unhappy to learn that some of the people they rely on are making those donations.""
He characterised Putin as a delusional leader obsessed with legacy who cared about how he would be viewed in 100 years time, adding: ""It doesn't matter that there's nothing left in Ukraine. Combine that with a sense of 'I've been wronged, Russia is owed everything and we are the great Russia' and you get to a point where he is not rational.""
Russia has taken heavy losses over the last few months with Ukraine pushing through a string of spectacular strategic victories against what initially seemed like appalling odds.
Asked if Putin knew the true situation on the ground, Mr Wallace thought he probably was aware of some of what was happening but not all. ""I think he genuinely believes the low casualty figures, that the army was invincible and that the Ukrainians would welcome them,"" he said. ""There we go, he got that wrong.""
The minister also does not believe that Putin will use nuclear weapons, despite his threats in a recent address to the nation. ""It's no secret that tactical nuclear weapons are in the (Russian) doctrine,"" he said. ""When they talk about tactical nuclear weapons it's really a weapon about five times the size of Hiroshima. It could be 10 times the size of Hiroshima.
""We think it's highly unlikely he will do it.""
Ukrainian forces have achieved their biggest breakthrough in the south of the country since the war began, bursting through the front and advancing rapidly along the Dnipro River, threatening to encircle thousands of Russian troops.
During a wide ranging discussion at the International Convention Centre, in Birmingham, Mr Wallace confirmed that he would soon be announcing a ""deep set"" of reforms to his department.
""It's a lifetime of fight. It's not an easy time now,"" he said. ""You don't see off the likes of Russia in a nice little neat campaign. Over the last few years defence has been hollowed out. (Money) was taken away from the unsexy parts of defence. This has been going on for decades.""
He said that decisions on how and where to invest in defence were being shaped by Ukraine and a number of other conflicts and threats around the world.
""I want to hold the PM to account on the pledges of defence,"" Mr Wallace said. ""Defence spending is not a discretionary luxury. The world is more unstable. We are constantly under some form of attack.""
The MP for Wyre and Preston North decided not stand in the recent Tory leadership election but said he had not ruled out a run for PM in the future.
""You have to really, really want it to be PM,"" he said. ""You have to want to sacrifice absolutely everything in your private and personal life. It carries with you a scar that is with you for life. It doesn't mean to say I wasn't tempted...""

","The United Kingdom is the greatest country on earth and I know its best days lie ahead. I am immensely proud of who we are and the values we stand for.
I am on the side of all those who work hard, get on in life and aspire for a better life for themselves and their family. These are the people who built our nation and made it great through their ingenuity, ideas and enterprise.
In these tough times, we cannot stick with business as usual. When I became Prime Minister, we were set for the highest tax burden in 70 years. Families and businesses were bracing themselves for energy bills to spiral in the wake of Putin’s appalling war.
That is why we have acted decisively to tackle the energy crisis by shielding families and businesses from astronomically high prices.
Our response to the energy crisis is the biggest part of our plan to get Britain moving. We are taking decisive action to get our economy growing by lowering the tax burden families and businesses face.
Cutting taxes helping families and businesses to keep more of their hard-earned money and invest in their future. We will also keep a firm hand on the nation’s finances as part of our commitment to sound money.
We are proud to be the party for growth. We will deliver by backing our brilliant businesses in generating that growth, jobs and wealth.
We will get rid of the burdens and barriers holding them back, from the large employers building the industries of the future to the dynamic entrepreneurs and self-employed.
We are the party who got Brexit done and will lead the way in seizing our new-found freedoms outside the European Union.
By the end of 2023, we will ensure all the red tape dreamt up in Brussels is gone. Instead, we will regulate in a way which is pro-growth, pro-consumer and pro-business.
We have a clear plan to put Britain on the path to national success. A key part of it is ensuring our great country is secure.
That is why we are doing so much more in response to the energy crisis than applying short-term sticking plasters. We are driving through the long-term reforms necessary to strengthen our energy security and make sure we are never in this position again.
We are maximising our production of home-grown energy, from gas fields in the North Sea to extracting our huge reserves of shale. We are getting on with delivering more nuclear energy and renewables.
This is how we will protect our environment, deliver on our commitment to net zero in a way which helps families and businesses, and tackle climate change.
We are taking decisive action to take on the vile people traffickers sending small boats across the English Channel by beefing up our Border Force and expanding the Rwanda scheme. Our party will ensure no European judge can frustrate our work to keep Britain’s borders secure.
Of course, we cannot have security at home without security abroad. That is why we are increasing spending on defence to three percent of GDP. In doing so, we will cement our status as the bulwark of European security and equip our Armed Forces with what they need to take on those who threaten us.
Putin has shown this week his continued disregard for international law in prosecuting his war against Ukraine. The UK will never accept the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as anything other than Ukrainian territory.
Ukraine’s victory is in all our interests. That is why we will stand firm alongside our allies in support of the Ukrainian people. We will not rest until Putin fails in his tyrannical ambitions.
Under my leadership, Britain will always stand up to bullies and stand unyielding in its defence of freedom and democracy around the world.
I know this week has been disruptive. But breaking with business as usual was not going to be easy. My determination to deliver for the British people will never waver.
We will always do what is right for the British people and our future.
I am ready to take tough decisions in the national interest. Sunday Express readers can rest assured, I will do what it takes to get Britain moving through these stormy days and put us on the path to long-term success.
Only the Conservatives can be trusted to deliver for the British people. We have a clear plan to build a new economy for the new era and the resolve to make it happen.

3,3120,"Vladimir Putin facing Ukraine 'humiliation' as Russian President made 'big mistake'
","VLADIMIR PUTIN is facing ""humiliation"" in Ukraine after making the ""big mistake"" of ""provoking the democratic bear"", according to a war reporter.
John Sweeney, who has spent months reporting from Kyiv, said the Russian President underestimated the Ukrainians with his invasion. And the former BBC journalist, who charts Putin's rise to power in new book Killer in the Kremlin, said he had ""absolutely no doubt"" Ukraine will win if the West ""holds its nerve"" and keeps up support and weapons.
Mr Sweeney told Express.co.uk: ""The great mistake he's made is to think that Ukrainians would fall over.
""And actually one of beautiful things about this terrible and stupid and brutal war is the idea that actually do not provoke the democratic bear and that's what Putin's done, it's a big mistake.
""So long as the West holds its nerve then I think the Ukrainians can beat them.
""The Russian army's spirits are low, the Ukrainian spirit is high, they are defending their homes.
""I believe the Ukrainians can stop the killing machine, push it back and that they can win.""
Mr Sweeney, who has reported from more than 80 countries during his career, said one reason he believes Russia will not succeed is because he has seen how ""corrupt"" Moscow is.
He also said Putin did not send enough manpower to fight his war in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance.
The journalist, who has become known for wearing his lucky orange hat in Kyiv, said a ""humiliating"" defeat in Ukraine would mark the beginning of the end for Putin.
He said: ""So I think the only way it can end is with Ukrainian victory. There is no other ending which is safe for the West.
""We have to see the end of the Putin regime and that is going to be accelerated by military victory.
""Any other outcome is a disaster for the West. Any compromise, statemate, that's a disaster.
""Our strategy has to be military defeat for the Russian killing machine, success for the Ukrainians causing him to be humiliated and that humiliation causing the people around him to get rid of him.""
The war reporter said the Russian leader's grip on the Kremlin was already weaker since launching his faltering assault on Ukraine in February.
After failing in its original aim of taking capital city Kyiv, Moscow has focused on pulverising parts of the east and south of the country.
Mr Sweeney said: ""Yes I think his position is much weaker. Tyrannies look strong then suddenly tomorrow bang they're gone.
""But I think that his control of the Kremlin's machinery is far weaker than it was before February 24.""
The journalist added that Russian soldiers will eventually ""vote with their feet because they realise they're fighting a pointless and stupid war for no good reason and the people who have sent them into battle have not sent them in with enough of the right stuff to deliver what they have to do"".
Amid speculation over Putin's health, Mr Sweeney said his appearance has dramatically changed since he doorstepped him in 2014 due to his puffy-looking face.
He said: ""I don't know the true state of Vladimir Putin's health. The reason I don't know that is because all the truth tellers in Moscow have been shot, poisoned, had to flee the country or they're in jail.
""Having said that when I saw him he looked like a weasel in the flesh and now he looks like a hamster. And that according to doctors is evidence of steroid overuse or abuse.""
On whether Putin is ""mad or bad"", Mr Sweeney said he had spoken to Ukrainian psychiatrist and former gulag prisoner Semyon Gluzman.
The journalist said: ""He believes Putin is not mad, he doesn't have hallucinations, he doesn't hear voices, he's sane but bad.
""You can be a psychopath, and still sane or not mad. This is good news because it means that he is a rational actor.
""The fact that the Russians made that rational decision to pull out of the battle of Kyiv means that Putin and his high command have some rationality.
""I felt that the possibility of Putin using nuclear weapons went away, I don't think it's a serious possibility.""
Mr Sweeney, whose book covers Putin from his childhood in Leningrad to his rise from KGB spy to leader, said the Russian President's goal is the ""complete destruction of Ukraine as an independent nation"".
But he added: ""Ukrainians have taught us democracy must be defended, free speech does not come for free.
""There is also another reason which is that if the Ukrainians go along with the Russians, then there is no more Ukraine.
""So they don't have an alternative. They fight or their country is annihilated. Their country, their culture, everything they believe in.
""So I feel they're fighting because they've got to fight but they're also teaching us a lesson that democracy must be defended.""",vladimir putin face ukraine humiliation as russian president make

4,3136,"What Are the Odds Putin is Bluffing About Using Nuclear Weapons?
","Eurointelligence founder Wolfgang Münchau has a thoughtful article on what Putin may or may not do.
Please consider What are the Odds?, emphasis mine.
I have received a number of emails over the last few days from correspondents who assert that the risk of a nuclear war was small, or that it was unlikely. It is worth reflecting on the meaning of these predictions in detail. What does unlikely mean when we are talking about a nuclear war?
I can translate it for you. It means: “I have no clue. But I have a feeling.” That feeling is based on assumptions that may sound plausible, but that we cannot be sure of. We think we know what Vladimir Putin considers to be in his strategic interest. We think some brave soul in the Russian command structure would heroically refuse to comply with a presidential nuclear launch order. We may think that these weapons are as dysfunctional as Russia’s tanks, that they explode at launch or mid-air. Or we think that there might be a coup against him before he has the opportunity to pull the trigger.
We can assert the probability of an earthquake, and attach a number to it. But there is no way we can do this here. We have no data and no probability distribution, and the usual weasel words are not helping us either.
All we have is intelligence from public sources and from our security services. They may have information about whether somebody is plotting against Putin. Or whether Putin faces internal opposition. But we have to treat such information professionally. Remember the weapons of mass destruction debacle? Back then, many western governments did not apply the highest standards of verification. We must ask ourselves: Is the source reliable? Is there a second source? Is there further corroboration? Do the sources have an agenda that may cause them to distort the truth, or lie?
Our western thinking about risk is rooted in the modern concept of probability, developed by the great Russian mathematician, Andrey Kolmogorov, in the 1930s. Probability and statistics allow us to calculate the numeric probability of an earthquake or help us with economic forecasts.
But this framework is not useful here. Right now, it is best to think not of quantifiable risk, but of unquantifiable uncertainty.
There are clearly scenarios that speak against Russia’s use of nuclear weapons. But I can think of two where the bomb goes off in the end. The first is one where Putin realises that he lost the war, where he knows he will not personally survive, and where he decides to take the western European enemy down with him. What speaks against this scenario is that Russia’s elite might frustrate this. They clearly have no desire to perish in a nuclear holocaust. It is possible that my scenario won’t happen. Then again, a last-minute intervention by the generals and the oligarchs may not happen, or it happens and fails, or happens, succeeds but comes too late. Let’s us not pretend that we are in a position to write the ending of this particular Hollywood script.
In my second scenario, Putin calculates that the launch of a smallish tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine would split the western alliance. In particular, it would break the Biden-Scholz axis. I have been arguing from the start of the war that the Germans are the weak link in the western alliance. Putin knows that too, and he might conclude that this is his most effective weapon.
Münchau says he cannot assign a probability to his scenarios. But no one else can either. And that is his point.
I can’t help but fixate on “Do the sources have an agenda that may cause them to distort the truth, or lie?”
There is no reason to trust what anyone says. The US state department lost whatever trust it had in the weapons of mass destruction fiasco.
Colin Powel aided President Bush’s agenda with a remarkable speech to the UN that anyone with an ounce of common sense knew was a lie.
It is a history of lies that caused considerable debate, even in this corner, about whether Putin would invade Ukraine or how far he might go if he did.

5,3122,"Florida Surgeon General Issues Warning For mRNA Coronavirus Vaccines: ‘FL Will Not Be Silent On The Truth’
","Florida Surgeon General Joseph A. Ladapo, MD, PhD, said in a statement Friday afternoon that the state now recommends against giving men ages 18 to 39 mRNA coronavirus vaccines, citing a heightened risk of cardiac-related death.
The statement from Ladapo comes at the conclusion of an analysis conducted by the Florida Department of Health that was carried out using a self-controlled case series, a technique used to evaluate vaccine safety, the state said.
“This analysis found that there is an 84% increase in the relative incidence of cardiac-related death among males 18-39 years old within 28 days following mRNA vaccination,” the statement said. “With a high level of global immunity to COVID-19, the benefit of vaccination is likely outweighed by this abnormally high risk of cardiac-related death among men in this age group. Non-mRNA vaccines were not found to have these increased risks.”
“As such, the State Surgeon General recommends against males aged 18 to 39 from receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines,” the statement continued. “Those with preexisting cardiac conditions, such as myocarditis and pericarditis, should take particular caution when making this decision.”
Most importantly, the analysis found that non-mRNA vaccines, such as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, “were not found to have these increased risks among any population.”
The analysis said that the mRNA vaccines also increased the risk of cardiac-related death in men over the age of 60 by 10%.
“Studying the safety and efficacy of any medications, including vaccines, is an important component of public health,” said Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo. “Far less attention has been paid to safety and the concerns of many individuals have been dismissed – these are important findings that should be communicated to Floridians.”
One study in Denmark has found that the absolute risk of two heart conditions (myocarditis and pericarditis) after taking a COVID mRNA vaccine varied between the type of vaccine taken.
“The corresponding rates of myocarditis or pericarditis within 28 days of vaccination in the Denmark study was 1.8 per 100 000 vaccinated individuals (95% CI, 0.8-3.4 per 100 000 vaccinated individuals) for BNT162b2 and 9.4 per 100 000 vaccinated individuals (95% CI, 5.0-16.0 per 100 000 vaccinated individuals) for mRNA-1273; dose 1 findings were not reported,” the Journal of the American Medical Association reported.
Today, we released an analysis on COVID-19 mRNA vaccines the public needs to be aware of. This analysis showed an increased risk of cardiac-related death among men 18-39. FL will not be silent on the truth.

6,3123,"Biden's Secret Promise To OPEC Backfires: Shellenberger
","In early September, United States Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, told Reuters that President Joe Biden was considering extending the release of oil from America’s emergency stockpiles, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), through October, and thus beyond the date when the program had been set to end. But then, a few hours later, an official with the Department of Energy called Reuters and contradicted Granholm, saying that the White House was not, in fact, considering more SPR releases. Five days later, the White House said it was considering refilling the SPR, thereby proposing to do the exact opposite of what Granholm had proposed.
The confusion around the Biden administration’s petroleum policy was cleared up yesterday after a senior official revealed that the White House had made a secret offer to buy up to 200 million barrels of OPEC+ oil to replenish the SPR in exchange for OPEC+ not cutting oil production. The official said the White House wanted to reassure OPEC+ that the US “won’t leave them hanging dry.” The fact that this offer was made through the White House, not the Department of Energy, may explain why a representative of the Department called Reuters to take back the remarks of Granholm, who has shown herself to be out-of-the-loop, and at a loss for words, relating to key administration decisions relating to oil and gas production.
The revelation poses political risks for Democrats who, in the spring of 2020, killed a proposal by President Donald Trump to replenish the SPR with oil from American producers, not OPEC+ ones, and at a price of $24 a barrel, not the $80 a barrel that the Biden White House promised to OPEC+. At the time, Trump was seeking to stabilize the American oil industry after the Covid-19 pandemic massively reduced oil demand. Trump and Congressional Republicans proposed spending $3 billion to fill the SPR. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer successfully defeated the proposal, and later bragged that his party had blocked a “bailout for big oil.”
Even normally strong boosters of the Biden White House viewed the Democrats’ opposition to refilling the SPR as a major blunder. “That decision,” noted Bloomberg, “effectively cost the US billions in potential profits and meant Biden had tens of millions of fewer barrels at his disposal with which to counter price surges.” Moreover, observed Bloomberg, it will take significantly more oil today to fill the SPR than it would have two years ago. In spring 2020, the SPR contained 634 million barrels out of a capacity of 727 million. Now, the reserve is below 442 million barrels, its lowest level in 38 years.
The decision looks even worse in light of the decision by OPEC+ today to cut production, which will increase oil prices. The Biden administration in recent days has been pulling out the stops trying to persuade Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ members, a group that includes Russia, to maintain today’s levels of oil production. Last Friday, the Biden administration sought a 45-day delay in a civil court proceeding over whether Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman should have sovereign immunity for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, for which bin Salman has taken responsibility.
The behavior by the Biden White House displays a willingness to sacrifice America’s commitment to human rights for the president’s short-term political needs. Instead of pleading with OPEC+ to maintain or increase high levels of oil production, the Biden administration could have simply allowed for expanded domestic oil production. Instead, Biden has issued fewer leases for on-shore and off-shore oil production than any president since World War II. As such, the pleadings by Biden and administration officials have backfired. The perception of the U.S. in the minds of OPEC+ members has weakened while the influence of Russian President Vladimir Putin has strengthened.
Why is that? Why did the Biden administration decide to spend so much political capital trying, and failing, to get Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ members to expand production when it could have simply expanded oil production domestically? What, exactly, is going on?

7,3137,"Central Banks Add Gold for Fifth Straight Month
","Central banks globally added to their net gold holdings for the fifth consecutive month in August, according to the latest data released by the World Gold Council.
On net, central banks added 20 more tons of gold to their reserves. Three banks drove buying in August and there were no notable sellers.
So far this year, central banks have added over 300 tons of gold to their goldings.
Turkey was the biggest buyer in August and has added more gold than any other country in 2022 to date. With its 8.9-ton purchase in August, Turkey has increased its gold reserves by 84 tons year-to-date. Turkey now holds 478 tons of gold between its central bank and treasury holdings, the highest level since Q2 2020.
Uzbekistan added 8.7 tons to its reserves in August, roughly the same amount as the previous five months. This brings its y-t-d net purchases to over 19 tons despite having begun the year by selling almost 25 tons in the first quarter. Gold reserves account for just over 60% of Uzbek’s total reserves.
After being the only notable seller in July, Kazakhstan bought 2 tons of gold in August. Total Kazakh gold reserves stand now just shy of 375 tons, down almost 28 tons since the start of the year. It is not uncommon for banks that buy from domestic production – such as Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan – to switch between buying and selling.
Mexico and Serbia both made small 0.1-ton purchases in August.
Qatar was the biggest gold buyer in July with an addition of 14.8 tons added to its reserves. Preliminary data published by the Qatar Central Bank suggests a further addition to its gold reserves during August, but the data has not been reported but the IMF IFS database. The WGC said it decided to exclude the Qatar purchase from their data until the IMF reports the official numbers.
India’s lack of gold purchases in August was notable. India had been buying gold consistently for months. India now owns 781 tons of gold, ranking it as the ninth largest gold-holding country in the world. Since resuming buying in late 2017, the Reserve Bank of India has purchased over 200 tons of gold. In August 2020, there were reports that the RBI was considering significantly raising its gold reserves.
Central banks purchase a net 270 tons of gold through the first half of the year. This fell in line with the five-year H1 average of 266 tons.
“This is a continuation of the strong buying that we saw last year and we now expect full-year central bank demand for 2022 to be on a par with 2021 levels,” a World Gold Council report said.
Central banks added 463 tons of gold to global reserves in 2021. That was 82% higher than in 2020.
A WGC survey found that “gold’s performance during a time of crisis and its role as a long-term store of value/inflation hedge are key determinants in the decisions of central banks to hold it.”
Last year was the 12th consecutive year of net purchases. Over that time, central banks have bought a net total of 5,692 tons of gold.
After record years in 2018 and 2019, central bank gold-buying slowed in 2020 with net purchases totaling about 273 tons. The lower rate of purchases in 2020 was expected given the strength of central bank buying both in 2018 and 2019. The economic chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic has also impacted the market.
Central bank demand came in at 650.3 tons in 2019. That was the second-highest level of annual purchases for 50 years, just slightly below the 2018 net purchases of 656.2 tons. According to the WGC, 2018 marked the highest level of annual net central bank gold purchases since the suspension of dollar convertibility into gold in 1971, and the second-highest annual total on record.

8,3133,"US denies 'preposterous' claim they 'sabotaged' Nord Stream 2 - as Trump shares video of Biden promising to 'bring an end' to pipeline 
","It comes as Donald Trump suggested that 'World War III' could be near while sharing a video of President Joe Biden threatening to stop Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Mysterious and alarming leaks were found in both Nord Stream pipelines this week, prompting the European Union to call it the result of a 'deliberate act.'
Multiple accusations have already been lobbed at the Kremlin amid ever-growing hostilities over its illegal invasion of Ukraine.
Meanwhile Moscow is pointing the finger at the United States, declaring that Washington is 'obliged' to explain its alleged role in the 'sabotage.'
A US official denied the accusations, according to the Washington Post. DailyMail.com has reached out to the White House for comment.
Trump also appeared to back Russia's theory on Wednesday when he posted on his Truth Social app a video of Biden from early February pledging to 'bring an end to' Nord Stream 2 if Vladimir Putin's forces invaded Ukraine.
'Wow, what a statement. World War III anyone?' Trump wrote along with the video.
The same video was also shared by the Russian government on Wednesday while suggesting Biden was behind the explosions that led to the Baltic Sea leaks.
Asked for clarification on his stance, Trump's spokesman Taylor Budowich said 'the statements speak for themselves.'
He also referred DailyMail.com to an earlier post where Trump offered to lead negotiations between Russia and Ukraine while warning current US leaders to not 'make matters worse.'
'U.S. ""Leadership"" should remain ""cool, calm, and dry"" on the SABOTAGE of the Nord Stream Pipelines. This is a big event that should not entail a big solution, at least not yet,' the former president wrote.
He ended with, 'Be strategic, be smart (brilliant!), get a negotiated deal done NOW. Both sides need and want it. The entire World is at stake. I will head up group???'
And just before that, Trump compared the pipelines' gas leak to the potentially devastated storm heading for the state of Florida. He said Hurricane Ian was not as 'important' as the damage in Europe's waters.
'Everyone is talking about the big hurricane barreling into Florida, as they should be, but perhaps a far more important event in the longer term was the announcement that the Nord Stream I & II Pipelines out of Russia...has been SABOTAGED,' he wrote in the earliest of the three posts.
In that statement Trump also stated he brought the pipelines 'to the World's attention as President when I explained how crippling reliance on it could be for Germany and other parts of Europe.'
'Everybody laughed at the time, but they are not laughing anymore!' he wrote.
During his presidency Trump did approve sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Germany and Russia, which was near completion when the penalties were levied in December 2019.
Biden waived US objection to the pipeline just several months into his White House term.
But it was soon halted again, this time by Germany, whose government canceled the plans in opposition to Russia recognizing parts of eastern Ukraine as independent pro-Kremlin states.
Putin launched his invasion just a few days later.
Nord Stream 1 was similarly out of operation due to Russia's war on Ukraine.
Though Nord Stream 2 never begun operations, it was full with gas by the time it was halted. Climate scientists fear the repercussions of the leak could be disastrous.
Sharing Biden's early February warnings on stopping the pipeline, the Kremlin's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on social media: 'Biden is obliged to answer the question of whether the US carried out its threat.'
'We must be responsible for our words,' the Putin puppet said, according to the Associated Press. 'Europe must know the truth.'

9,3127,"Did Uncle Sam, a.k.a. Wile E. Coyote, Blow Up the Wrong Pipeline?
","After “parties not-so-unknown” bombed the Nordstream gas pipeline, Anthony Blinken celebrated the “tremendous opportunity.” He assumed the whole Nordstream operation was out of commission. That would have given US producers the chance to make billions of dollars robbing Europe blind selling overpriced gas.
But Blinken may have celebrated too soon. According to Bloomberg News:
After the suspected sabotage of the network last week in a series of explosions, Gazprom said on Monday three of the lines were affected and one wasn’t. The gas giant has lowered pressure on the unaffected line B of Nord Stream 2 to inspect the link for damage and potential leaks, it said in a statement on its Telegram account.
An Unz Review commenter explained:
“The vaunted US Navy screwed up. In the murky depths of the Baltic Sea they planted their explosives to blow up the ***FOUR*** pipes of the NS 1 & NS2 gas pipelines. (You didn’t know there were four pipes, did you? Neither did I.) But they appear to have screwed up and placed two of the explosive packages on one of the NS2 pipes — line A — leaving the other pipe — line B — with no explosive charge, and subsequently ***NO DAMAGE***. Line B is therefore ***READY TO GO*** with a capacity of 27.5 billion cubic meters per year … which for comparison is 50% of total capacity of Nordstream 1, which as you may recall was recently reduced to 20% capacity before being shut down completely. (2.75 times the capacity of the newly-opened Norway-to-Poland gas pipeline).”
So if Germany gets annoyed at the arrogant American terrorists’ attempt to loot and wreck their economy, all the Germans have to do is cancel their sanctions on Russia and ask Putin to turn on the spigot, which could cause NATO to quickly unravel. If that happens, the Nordstream terror attack will turn out to be one of the worst own goals in strategic history.
Even if this worst-case scenario (from the US perspective) fails to quickly materialize, the botched Nordstream bombing could rebound disastrously against the perpetrators. Cutting Germany’s Russian gas lifeline and replacing it with inadequate quantities of overpriced US gas may have sounded like a good idea in the short term, since it will butress the dollar against the euro and keep the EU tethered to its US vassal status, cut off from the vast resources of Russia. But over the medium term, as non-Western nations continue to gain ever-greater shares of global GDP while the West declines, sabotaging the economy of your biggest vassal seems self-defeating, even in the unlikely event that the Europeans never decide to push back.
The Nordstream terror fiasco takes its place in a long series of stunningly stupid moves by the world’s erstwhile hegemon. The US could have thrived in the post-Cold-War environment by making win-win deals with all major nations and civilizations. Instead, as Putin observed in last week’s speech, it has managed to alienate most of the world with its psychopathic arrogance and blood-splattering vandalism. By looting Russia and pushing NATO eastward in the 1990s, launching a false flag war on Islam in 2001, and more recently alienating Russia, China, Iran, and the whole Islamic world simultaneously, the strategic geniuses running America’s national security state seem to be deliberately creating the mother of all anti-Western coalitions.
Does the Empire harbor a secret death wish? Is unconscious guilt (at betraying the American Republicand mass murdering millions abroad) driving the national security brain trust to self-destruct? Maybe. But first let’s consider two other explanations, one obvious, the other conspiratorial.
First the obvious one: The permanent US national security state has been absolutely corrupted by absolute power. When the Cold War ended and the US emerged as a unipolar hegemon, the managers of empire started to believe “We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality.” That’s hubris at best, psychosis at worst. They started to think they could get away with just about anything. Such delusions of grandeur unleashed a feeding frenzy among those who gorge themselves at the military-industrial-complex trough. Corruption and incompetence danced off together in a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop. Nobody had to worry much about the real-world consequences of bad decisions, because “we” lived in “our own reality” of apparent omnipotence.
But US policy has been so conspicuously self-destructive that it’s hard not to wonder whether it might be intentional. Could some hostile power have taken over the American brain and driven the nation to self-destruction, the way toxoplasmosis parasites take over the brains of mice and make them fall in love with cats?
The nation poised to gain the most from self-defeating US policies is China. Whoever decided to export American manufacturing to China, then waste more than $7 trillion fighting Muslims for no particular reason, then pick a fight with Russia in Ukraine, might as well have been a Chinese sleeper agent. Even the belated anti-China trade war launched in 2019, followed by the apparent COVID attack on Wuhan, were so insanely ineffective that they could easily have been scripted by a CCP version of Dr. Fu Manchu.
But there is no evidence that the CCP is secretly running US foreign policy. If there is a toxoplasmosis type parasite steering Uncle Sam’s brain, it would be the Zionist neocons. These people are drunk on Leo Strauss’s self-styled philosophy of evil. The whole notion of win-win give-and-take diplomacy and negotiation is foreign to them. They never met an act of extreme imperial chutzpah they didn’t like. From 9/11 and the wars it was designed to spark, to the 2014 de facto declaration of war on Russia through the coup in Kiev, to the late autumn 2019 COVID attack on Wuhan and Qom, to the recent blundering attempt to take Nordstream permanently off-line, the neocons keep doing insane things ostensibly designed to strengthen the US empire, but covertly undermining it.
Are the Zio-cons scheming to destroy the US and then dominate the New World Order that arises from its ashes? Or are they merely so unhinged and fanatical in their pro-US-imperial hubris that they keep doing insanely counterproductive things?

10,3126,"U.S., European health officials admit Microsoft founder Bill Gates runs the globe
","(Natural News) A startling report published earlier this week by Politico admitted what a growing number of Westerners and especially Americans have suspected for quite some time: The world literally is being run by Microsoft founder Bill Gates.
According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, the story essentially noted these main points:
— The Sept. 14 Politico special report was based on interviews with four dozen U.S. and European officials as well as global health officials who admitted that the global COVID-19 response is being run by a computer nerd who made his fortune building substandard computer platforms;
— A quad of health organizations — The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, GAVI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the Wellcome Trust — quickly took over the global response to the pandemic, and while they all claim that they are independent groups, in fact, they were all either founded by or are funded by Gates himself;
— As the outbreak first began to spread, the Gates Foundation, GAVI, CEPI, and the Wellcome Trust started to coordinate their actions such as identifying vaccine makers while funding vax tests, drug treatments and mRNA injections, while also putting together a global distribution system in a collaboration with the World Health Organization — but they failed to actually meet their own objectives on all fronts;
— Again, Gates is a computer nerd and is not at all qualified to make global health recommendations, let alone take the lead in a global pandemic response;
— What’s more, Gates has never been elected to represent the public in general or Americans in particular.
“The idea that Bill Gates exerts undue influence over global health has consistently been denied and dismissed as a loony conspiracy theory. But as with so many other things, this conspiracy theory is now turning out to be a conspiracy fact,” Mercola reported, noting that the Politico piece was originally titled, “How Bill Gates and His Partners Took Over the Global COVID Response.”
However, as noted by Igor Chudov on Substack, the headline was later changed to read: “How Four Private Groups Used Their Clout to Control the Global COVID Response — With Little Oversight.”
Mercola noted that, for some reason, Politico changed the headline again, and it now reads: “How Bill Gates and partners used their clout to control the global Covid response — with little oversight.”
“While the most powerful nations looked inward, four non-governmental global health organizations began making plans for a life-or-death struggle against a virus that would know no boundaries,” Politico reported, adding: “What followed was a steady, almost inexorable shift in power from the overwhelmed governments to a group of non-governmental organizations, according to a seven-month investigation” by the outlet reporters in the U.S. and Europe, in conjunction with the German newspaper WELT.
“Armed with expertise, bolstered by contacts at the highest levels of Western nations and empowered by well-grooved relationships with drug makers, the four organizations took on roles often played by governments — but without the accountability of governments,” the report continued.
To date, the four groups have collectively spent around $10 billion on COVID since 2020, more than enough to make several individuals involved very rich. That includes some $1.4 billion given to the WHO, which hid the fact that China was responsible for both developing COVID and its spread around the world.
“The organizations’ leaders had unprecedented access to the highest levels of governments, spending at least $8.3 million to lobby lawmakers and officials in the U.S. and Europe,” Politico noted in a “key takeaway” from its lengthy story. “Officials from the U.S., EU and representatives from the WHO rotated through these four organizations as employees, helping them solidify their political and financial connections in Washington and Brussels.”
Kate Elder, senior vaccines policy adviser for the Doctors Without Borders’ Access Campaign, asked one obvious question: “What makes Bill Gates qualified to be giving advice and advising the U.S. government on where they should be putting the tremendous resources?”
The answer is always the same: Money that is used not for good but to purchase access and influence.

Russian state TV pundit admits ‘things aren’t going well’
Vladimir Putin is under increasing pressure as the Russian leader suffers a series of humiliating setbacks in Ukraine. A former Russian deputy foreign minister raised the possibility that Kyiv could even bomb Russia, including Moscow, given the state of the war. The conversation on Russian state television also saw another pundit suggest they are forbidden from discussing Ukraine's recent re-capture of Lyman.
The former deputy foreign minister and senior Russian diplomat, Andrei Federov, warned that the loss of Lyman, a strategic town in eastern Ukraine, could lead to even more setbacks for Russia.
He suggested Ukraine could even bomb Moscow, as he explained: ""Radical changes are taking place because Russia occupied, or rather they say, annexed these areas.
""For that reason, Ukraine is starting a war to liberate these territories. Not some kind of special operation, but a war.""
Mr Fedorov said that the Ukraine military could target a direct strike deep into Russian territory.

When asked whether Moscow could be struck, the senior Kremlin diplomat responded bluntly: ""Yes, of course.""
Commentator Maxim Yusin later admitted on the programme that pundits are told in the make-up room not to discuss the recent losses in Ukraine.
In a rare admission on state TV, Mr Yusin said: ""We aren't talking about what is happening in Lyman.""
When the host denies the topic is ""forbidden,"" the commentator responds: ""Ask anyone here when they're in the make-up room.
""I think anyone will honestly admit that they don't know whether the mobilization will help us or not to change the course of military actions.

12,3124,"FDA Withholding Autopsy Results on People Who Died After Getting ‘Covid’ Fake Vaccines
","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is refusing to release the results of autopsies conducted on people who died after getting COVID-19 vaccines.
The FDA says it is barred from releasing medical files, but a drug safety advocate says that it could release the autopsies with personal information redacted.
The refusal was issued to The Epoch Times, which submitted a Freedom of Information Act for all autopsy reports obtained by the FDA concerning any deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System following COVID-19 vaccination.
Reports are lodged with the system when a person experiences an adverse event, or a health issue, after receiving a vaccine. The FDA and other agencies are tasked with investigating the reports. Authorities request and review medical records to vet the reports, including autopsies.
The FDA declined to release any reports, even redacted copies.
The FDA cited federal law, which enables agencies to withhold information if the agency “reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption,” with the exemption being “personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”
Federal regulations also bar the release of “personnel, medical and similar files the disclosure of which constitutes a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”
The Epoch Times has appealed the denial, in addition to the recent denial of results of data analysis of VAERS reports.
Kim Witczak, a drug safety advocate who advises the FDA as part of the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee, said that the reports could be released with personal information blacked out.
“The personal information could easily be redacted without losing the potential learnings from [the] autopsy,” Witczak told The Epoch Times via email.
People make the choice to submit autopsy results to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, Witczak noted.

","This is what the Russians are planning and it’s likely going to lead to a full scale war with NATO.
I’m 31 and this is insane. I’ve always been into old nuke propaganda videos and civil defense shorts, but I never thought I’d be experiencing it now first hand like those during the height of the cold war and Cuban missile crisis. What the actual hell is happening right now?
Thank you for the update! We have to remember that Russia is playing by rules – its own rules, true, but they are concerned about making sure to keep everything legal. For internal reasons, and also for their allies & supporters: China, India, Brazil, Iran, etc. That is why they are proceeding so scrupulously to incorporate those 4 territories legally, which will not be finalized by their Duma for another couple of days. Once that happens, watch out! They will no longer be bound by the rules of a Special Military Operation, as for them, they will be defending their own territory. In the meantime, Ukraine is making some military break-throughs – which is likely to step up the stakes for Russia & feed into the imminent escalation.

14,3118,"Al Gore Compares ‘Climate Deniers’ To Police In Uvalde, Attacks Senate Filibuster For Blocking Action On Climate Change
","Climate activist and former Democratic Vice President Al Gore on Sunday said “climate deniers” were comparable to the police officers who failed to act during the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas.
Appearing as a guest on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Gore assailed Republicans and tactics like the Senate filibuster for preventing Democrats from passing legislation to tackle global warming. Gore compared “climate deniers” in Congress to police officers who were equipped and trained to deal with mass shooters, but failed to stop the tragedy at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde.
“You know, the climate deniers are really in some ways similar to all of those, almost 400 law enforcement officers in Uvalde, Texas, who were waiting outside an unlocked door while the children were being massacred,” Gore told host Chuck Todd.
“They heard the screams. They heard the gunshots and nobody has stepped forward,” he continued. “God bless those families that suffered so much. And law enforcement officials tell us that’s not typical of what law enforcement usually does.”
“And confronted with this global emergency, what we’re doing with our inaction in failing to walk through the door and stop the killing is not typical of what we are capable of as human beings. We do have the solutions. And I think these extreme events that are getting steadily worse and more severe are really beginning to change minds. We have to have unity as a nation to come together and stop making this a political football. It shouldn’t be a partisan issue.”
Gore then blasted the filibuster for preventing Congress from taking action, again comparing climate change to the Uvalde shooting.
“The same reason it is seemingly impossible for the Congress to pass legislation banning these weapons of war, these assault rifles that are being used to murder children in classrooms and create hundreds of mass casualty events already this year and that’s getting worse, the same reason we can’t pass legislation to, for example, to reinstate the ban on assault weapons is the same reason that we can’t pass climate legislation: we have the minority government,” said Gore.
“We have the filibuster still, which ought to be eliminated,” he added. “We have big money playing much too large a role in our politics, lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry, and they’re still running all of these advertisements trying to convince people that ‘it’s not that bad’ or ‘they’ve got this, don’t worry about it.’ We have got to rise to this challenge.”
“We, the people, have to solve this, and we have to instruct those who are in positions of leadership to start doing the right thing. Our survival as a species may depend upon it.”",al gore compare climate denier to police in uvalde attack senate filibuster for block action on climate change,"[(al, 'NNP'), (gore, 'NNP'), (compare,

15,3119,"'Dim-witted Duke' Prince Harry slammed for wading into US abortion debate
","PRINCE HARRY has been branded a ""dim-witted duke"" over comments linked to the debate over US abortion rights.
The Duke of Sussex spoke at the United Nations on Monday to mark Nelson Mandela International Day in honour of the late leader of South Africa. Harry delivered a speech which made reference to what he called the reversal of constitutional rights in the United States and the ""weaponizing"" of lies and disinformation.
Harry said: ""This has been a painful year in a painful decade. We're living through a pandemic that continues to ravage communities in every corner of the globe; climate change wreaking havoc on our planet, with the most vulnerable suffering most of all; the few, weaponizing lies and disinformation at the expense of the many; and from the horrific war in Ukraine to the rolling back of constitutional rights here in the United States.
""We are witnessing a global assault on democracy and freedom - the cause of Mandela's life.""
His remarks sparked a backlash among critics with one op-ed in Spiked describing him as a ""dimwitted duke"" for ""sticking his oar into the debate over abortion rights in the US.
Harry's comment about rights has been seen as a thinly veiled swipe at the US Supreme Court's ruling to overturn Roe v Wade, which was a landmark decision conferring the right to have an abortion.
Writer Charlie Peters, in the Spiked op-ed, said: ""Prince Harry's speech was full to the brim with many other unwanted and ignorant 'insights'.
""Take for example his contention that constitutional rights are being rolled back in the US. As Amber Athey explains in Spectator World, Harry clearly misunderstands what the Supreme Court’s Roe ruling actually involved.
""Whatever we may think of the court’s decision and its implications, it did not 'roll back' a constitutional right as such – it ruled there was never a constitutional right to abortion in the first place.
""The judges argued a woman’s decision to have an abortion was not covered by the constitutional 'right to privacy', as Roe had previously held.""
He concluded: ""Perhaps when Harry is done delivering these sixth-former activist speeches, he could take the time to actually learn something about America and the wider world, rather than just regurgitating high-status opinions. I won’t hold my breath.""
Harry also spoke about his mother Diana, the Princess of Wales, meeting with the former South African leader in March 1997 and how he ""sought solace"" in Africa after her death.
Speaking about Diana, Harry said: ""On my wall, and in my heart every day, is an image of my mother and Mandela meeting in Cape Town in 1997.
""The photo was presented to me by the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whose friendship and inspiration were their own treasured gift. My wife and I had the honour of introducing our four-month-old son to him back in 2019.
""When I first looked at the photo, straightaway what jumped out was the joy on my mother's face - the playfulness, cheekiness, even... pure delight to be in communion with another soul so committed to serving humanity.
""Then I looked at Mandela. Here was a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders, asked to heal his country from the wreckage of its past and transform it for the future.
""A man who had endured the very worst of humanity - vicious racism and state-sponsored brutality. A man who had lost 27 years with his children and family that he would never get back.""
Harry, who was joined at the United Nation's headquarters in New York by his wife Meghan Markle, said he has ""always found hope"" in Africa, a continent where he ""found peace and healing"".
He added: ""It's where I've felt closest to my mother and sought solace after she died, and where I knew I had found a soulmate in my wife.""
Harry also warned of the impact of climate change on Africa and the world during his speech.
He said: ""This crisis will only grow worse, unless our leaders lead, unless the countries represented by the seats in this hallowed hall make the decisions - the daring, transformative decisions - our world needs to save humanity.""",dim witte duke prince harry slam for wade into we abortion debate,"[(dim, 'NNP'), (witte, 'NNP'), (duke, 'NNP'), (prince, 'NNP'), (harry, 'NNP'), (slam, 'NNP'),

16,3131,"American Pravda: Of Pipelines and Plagues
","Europe is facing its worst energy crisis in generations, with numerous factories shutting down and severe hardship expected during the approaching winter. Heavily-industrialized Germany has been especially hard hit, with more than half of all small- and mid-sized businesses fearful that they might be forced to close, an economic catastrophe of Great Depression proportions. The only near-term hope of salvation had been an end to the self-destructive energy sanctions these countries had imposed upon Russia, which would have allowed plentiful and cheap Russian natural gas to resume flowing through the Russian-owned Nord Stream pipelines.
Although the European governments remained firmly opposed to that solution, many ordinary Europeans felt differently, and in recent days large public demonstrations in Germany and the Czech Republic had demanded that the sanctions be lifted. There was widespread speculation that such popular protests would eventually carry the day, if not immediately then once winter hardship became too severe. The outcome would be a negotiated end to the Ukraine war along the general lines suggested by Russia, resulting in a strategic defeat for America and NATO.

They demand an end to sanctions on Russia and the reopening of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Demonstrations also in other German cities but EU media censors them. pic.twitter.com/dmTMLY11jn
Then on September 26th, this geopolitical landscape was upended as a series of large explosions severely damaged the huge Russian pipelines, putting them out of commission indefinitely, probably even permanently. With the pipelines no longer operational, Europe would have to make due with the limited supply of American gas that can be shipped by tanker, at a cost many times greater. The massive explosive attacks on the undersea pipelines—rather euphemistically characterized as “sabotage” in the media headlines—had occurred near the coastal waters of Denmark and Sweden, in an area of the Baltic heavily monitored and patrolled by NATO warships.
Given these simple, undeniable facts, the likely suspects were rather obvious, but they still remained almost completely unmentionable in the Western media coverage. Instead, the Washington Post, hometown newspaper of the American government, ran an article with the headline “European leaders blame Russian ‘sabotage’ after Nord Stream explosions,” quoting a long list of anonymous government sources making that nonsensical claim, which was widely echoed across most Western media outlets. Our political elites apparently assumed that their tight media control will ensure that their ignorant citizenry could be made to believe—or at least pretend to believe—almost anything, even that the Russians had destroyed their own pipelines.
But public media statements do not necessarily reflect private beliefs. Prominent Neocon journalist Anne Applebaum had spent years on the Editorial Board of the Washington Post and her husband is Radek Sikorski, Poland’s former Foreign and Defense Minister and someone with the strongest possible ties to the America’s political and national security establishment. Twitter allows individuals to casually blurt out statements that they may later regret, and the day after the pipeline explosions he issued a series of Tweets celebrating the attacks, including one showing a photo of the resulting destruction with the telling caption “Thank You, USA.” That last Tweet soon went super-viral with some 13,500 Retweets and 44,200 Likes, leading him to quickly delete it.
Someone else on Twitter shrewdly described that desperate backpedaling:
After the US destroyed the pipelines there was radio silence as the regime was trying to determine their narrative. This delay caused a Polish official to publicly thank the US for the attack.
Then word went out yesterday to deny the attack. The NATO propaganda bots are out. 
Given the near-unanimous media drumbeat that the Russians had destroyed their own multi-billion-dollar pipelines, presumably because of their evil insanity, it’s quite possible that a majority, perhaps even a large majority of our citizens will blandly accept that story, just as they have so many other, equally ridiculous concoctions of the past. But I would think that nearly all our elites who are paying any attention to the issue strongly suspect or even flatly assume that elements of the American government played a central role in the attacks, though almost none of them would publicly admit such a thing.
One of the tiny handful of brave exceptions to this enforced silence and perhaps the only such individual with a large media platform was Tucker Carlson, and a couple of days after the attack, he broadcast a segment on the topic to his audience of millions. He noted that although it might seem unimaginable that the American government would commit such an act of international terrorism as illegally destroying pipelines so important to Europe’s industrial economy, perhaps that might be what actually happened.
Among other things, he showed clips of both President Joe Biden and Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland explicitly threatening to eliminate the Nord Stream pipelines if a Russia-Ukraine broke out.
BIDEN admits US behind sabotage of Nordstream 1 and 2.
Biden: ""If Russia invades…then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.""
Reporter: ""But how will you do that, it's in germany's control?""
Biden: ""I promise you, we will be able to do that."" 
Victoria Nuland: “If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward”
Also this is the same Victoria Nuland who said fuck the EU, and she sure did it to you Germany.
And immediately following the attacks, Secretary of State Antony Blinken mentioned that the bombing would greatly benefit American interests, offering our country “tremendous strategic opportunity for the years to come.”
According to @SecBlinken, the Nord Stream pipeline bombing ""offers tremendous strategic opportunity for the years to come."" Too bad that this tremendous opportunity for DC bureaucrats will come at the expense of everyone else, especially this coming winter. 
Despite his past public statements, I tend to doubt that Biden himself had played any role in the decision-making process, or that he was even personally informed of the planned attack. He is merely a figurehead, an elderly non-entity who generally says whatever he is told to say, but he has also become notorious for making public statements that his horrified subordinates must immediately “clarify” and that would have been an obvious risk in this situation. So to the extent that our President is even aware that Europe’s largest energy pipelines were attacked and severely damaged, it’s quite possible that he is in that small minority of high-ranking individuals who has no idea of who may have been responsible or even blames it on the Russians, because his handlers have told him so.
The vacuum left by an almost entirely dishonest or timorous media has been filled by a handful of courageous independent bloggers, with Moon of Alabama and John Helmer probably providing some of the best early analysis of what had probably happened:
- The War On Germany Just Entered Its Hot Phase
- The Bornholm Blow-Up Repeats the Bornholm Bash—Poland Attacks Germany and Blames Russia
- Whodunnit? – Facts Related to The Sabotage Attack On The Nord Stream Pipelines
The particular details of the attacks have relatively little importance and the early speculation has gone in several directions. The theory advanced by Helmer, a longtime American correspondent based in Moscow, is that the actual operation was carried out by Polish forces with America’s intelligence and technical support. This seems quite plausible since Poland has been fiercely hostile to Russia and the Russian pipelines, which would annually cost the country many hundreds of millions of dollars in lost future pipeline transit fees. The Poles had made every possible effort to block the Nord Stream project and Poland’s nearby coast would provide an ideal staging ground for the attack. Moreover, by an astonishing coincidence, the attack occurred exactly as Poland had opened a much smaller pipeline, allowing it to supply its own energy needs from Norway, completely independent of Nord Stream.
But whether or not the operation was carried out by Polish proxies or even Ukrainians, those local allies are totally dependent upon our goodwill for their survival, and it is inconceivable that they would have taken this momentous step without the approval and supervision of powerful elements of the American national security establishment, so debating who actually planted the explosives is merely a red herring.
Despite the lack of any hard evidence, the likelihood that America played a central role in the attacks seems a near-certainty. Means, motive, and opportunity all point so strongly in a single direction that I doubt that there are too many rational, intelligent individuals who sincerely believe otherwise, although for obvious reasons they may mouth deceptive evasions or choose to keep silent. Yet virtually no one in the major media is willing to recognize this obvious reality.
And this disingenuous reaction has even extended to large segments of the supposedly fearless alternative media. Although these enormously important attacks reached the front pages of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, not a word about them appeared in Counterpunch, the Nation, or the New Republic, and barely any mention at Antiwar.com, presumably for fear that their pieces would necessarily have to mention the prime suspect. Various Internet pundits have promoted the most absurd alternate possibilities in order to avoid fingering the American government. This widespread “See No Evil” response is illustrated by a popular Internet meme:
Let us step back and place this incident in its proper historical context, recognizing the astonishing recklessness. We are not currently at war with Russia let alone Germany, and a $20 billion energy project important to both those countries has been wrecked, with a potentially devastating impact upon the European economy. Not only is this probably the greatest peacetime military attack upon civilian infrastructure in world history, but if we exclude the 9/11 attacks—officially ascribed to a non-state terrorist organization—nothing even remotely comparable comes to mind.
Consider the obvious possibility of retaliation. Russia possesses a very powerful and sophisticated military with excellent special forces, and the West’s own energy infrastructure is woefully vulnerable and unprotected. Moreover, our heavily financialized economy might collapse like a house of cards if it were struck a tiny blow in the right location, with Tucker Carlson noting that if Russia merely cut the transatlantic fiber-optic cables connecting financial markets in the US and Europe, Wall Street would suffer gigantic losses.
But I think the greatest risk our country faces is an automatic consequence of our attacks on Europe’s critical energy infrastructure even absent any significant Russian reprisals.
If Germany and the rest of Europe undergo an economic collapse, the American economy can hardly avoid severe damage as well, but I think the more important impact will be upon the longer-term geopolitical alignment of that continent. Europeans will suffer greatly this winter and despite the solid wall of media propaganda, more and more of them may begin to recognize the architect of their distress.
For nearly three generations, our NATO allies have constituted a crucial element of America’s global military and economic power, and if they see their repayment as being a treacherous, criminal attack with devastating consequences, they may eventually decide to shift their allegiance in a different direction. The hashtag #Kriegserklaerung---“declaration of war”—was recently trending for several days on Twitter, with numerous Germans saying that America had declared war against their country. Overwhelming control over electronic and social media represents a powerful brain-washing tool, but at some point its effectiveness may be overwhelmed by miserable reality. The old Soviet Union never inflicted such deliberate suffering upon its Warsaw Pact vassals and that alliance collapsed in 1989, so if some of the more dismal economic predictions for Europe are realized, I wonder if NATO will long survive.
From a broader perspective, industrialized Germany and resource-rich Russia are natural trading partners, and as Mike Whitney so presciently argued back in February, much of America’s recent European strategy has been aimed at blocking their growing economic ties. Our destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines may have temporarily prevented any immediate German defection, but the bitterness we will have earned may be even more significant in the future. If Germany shifted its political ties eastward, America’s power in Europe would be shattered, and German voters do have a say in such matters, especially if they begin to suffer Depression-like conditions in the next few months.
The establishment of a full-fledged Russian-German alliance would completely reshape the geopolitics of Eurasia, but I suspect that our ignorant government leaders would dismiss such a possibility as an absurd fantasy given what they imagine is the deep traditional hostility between those two populations. However, as I explained a few years ago, this is completely incorrect, being based upon an extremely skewed misreading of European history:
In my unjustified arrogance, I also sometimes relished a sense of seeing obvious things that magazine or newspaper journalists got so completely wrong, mistakes which often slipped into historical narratives as well. For example, discussions of the titanic 20th century military struggles between Germany and Russia quite often made casual references to the traditional hostility between those two great peoples, who for centuries had stood as bitter rivals, representing the eternal struggle of Slav against Teuton for dominion over Eastern Europe.
Although the bloodstained history of the two world wars made that notion seem obvious, it was factually mistaken. Prior to 1914, those two nationalities had not fought against each other for the previous 150 years, and even the Seven Years’ War of the mid-18th century had involved a Russian alliance with Germanic Austria against Germanic Prussia, hardly amounting to a conflict along civilizational lines. Russians and Germans had been staunch allies during the endless Napoleonic wars and closely cooperated during the Metternich and Bismarck eras that followed, while even as late as 1904, Germany had supported Russia in its unsuccessful war against Japan. During the 1920s, Weimar Germany and Soviet Russia had a period of close military cooperation, the Hitler-Stalin Pact of 1939 marked the beginning of the Second World War, and throughout the long Cold War, the USSR had no more loyal a satellite than East Germany. Perhaps two dozen years of hostility over the last three centuries, with good relations or even ou
tright alliance during most of the remainder, hardly suggested that Russians and Germans were hereditary enemies.
Moreover, during much of that period, Russia’s ruling elite had had a considerable Germanic tinge. Russia’s legendary Catherine the Great had been a German princess by birth, and over the centuries so many Russian rulers had taken German wives that the later Czars of the Romanov dynasty were usually more German than Russian. Russia itself had a substantial but heavily assimilated German population, which was very well represented in elite political circles, with German names being quite common among government ministers and sometimes found among important military commanders. Even a top leader of the Decembrist revolt of the early 19th century had had German ancestry but was a zealous Russian-nationalist in his ideology.
If the looming economic calamity does eventually shift Germany to a Russian alliance, the American attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines will be remembered as the blow that altered the entire trajectory of global politics.
To this point, most readers will probably be nodding their heads at the factual observations I have made even if they doubt some of the suggested possible consequences. Perhaps America’s destruction of Europe’s energy pipelines and the resulting economic devastation of Germany will lead to a permanent rupture in the Western alliance, or perhaps not; the future is difficult to predict.
But although there is not a single shred of hard evidence indicating American involvement, the circumstantial case is so overwhelmingly strong that no sensible person can come to any other conclusion. Whether or not we acted through local proxies, our government was clearly responsible for the destruction of Europe’s most important energy infrastructure, an act of absolutely colossal criminality and recklessness, which may have enormously negative consequences for our own national interests. Virtually all Western mainstream media outlets and many alternative ones may scrupulously avoid this reality and paid propagandists may energetically dispute it, but it remains the obvious truth.
And here’s the rub. This entire scenario seems remarkably similar to another that I have advanced over the last couple of years on an entirely different topic. Beginning in April 2020, I have published a long series of articles arguing that the global Covid epidemic was the result of an American biowarfare attack against China (and Iran).
Just as with President Biden, Donald Trump himself was similarly out of the loop, but the attack was probably orchestrated by top figures in his administration, who immediately tried (somewhat successfully) to blame the Chinese for the viral epidemic that began in their own country. Once again, virtually all of the relevant facts have been ignored by the Western media, but can easily be found and connected together. And once again, the weight of circumstantial evidence seems overwhelming, indeed in many respects far stronger than that for the pipeline attacks.
During the thirty months I have been making this case, the only strong argument ever presented against it was the claim that not even rogue elements of the Trump administration could have been so reckless as to launch a biowarfare attack, an attack whose unintended blowback eventually killed over a million Americans and disrupted the lives of billions worldwide. But our destruction of Europe’s most crucial energy infrastructure demonstrates the true depths of the criminal recklessness sometimes found in the American government.
Once individuals have fully absorbed the broader implications of the Nord Stream attacks, including the widespread but ridiculous media claims that the Russians destroyed their own pipelines, they should reassess their assumptions regarding American governmental behavior and also reexamine the circumstances of the Covid outbreak with a fresh eye.
In particular, they should note the strikingly clear evidence of American foreknowledge of the outbreak, which can be summarized in just a few hundred words:
For example, in 2017 Trump brought in Robert Kadlec, who since the 1990s had been one of America’s leading biowarfare advocates. The following year in 2018 a mysterious viral epidemic hit China’s poultry industry and in 2019, another mysterious viral epidemic devastated China’s pork industry…
From the earliest days of the administration, leading Trump officials had regarded China as America’s most formidable geopolitical adversary, and orchestrated a policy of confrontation. Then from January to August 2019, Kadlec’s department ran the “Crimson Contagion” simulation exercise, involving the hypothetical outbreak of a dangerous respiratory viral disease in China, which eventually spreads into the United States, with the participants focusing on the necessary measures to control it in this country. As one of America’s foremost biowarfare experts, Kadlec had emphasized the unique effectiveness of bioweapons as far back as the late 1990s and we must commend him for his considerable prescience in having organized a major viral epidemic exercise in 2019 that was so remarkably similar to what actually began in the real world just a few months later.
With leading Trump officials greatly enamored of biowarfare, fiercely hostile to China, and running large-scale 2019 simulations on the consequences of a mysterious viral outbreak in that country, it seems entirely unreasonable to completely disregard the possibility that such extremely reckless plans may have been privately discussed and eventually implemented, though probably without presidential authorization.
But with the horrific consequences of our own later governmental inaction being obvious, elements within our intelligence agencies have sought to demonstrate that they were not the ones asleep at the switch. Earlier this month, an ABC News story cited four separate government sources to reveal that as far back as late November, a special medical intelligence unit within our Defense Intelligence Agency had produced a report warning that an out-of-control disease epidemic was occurring in the Wuhan area of China, and widely distributed that document throughout the top ranks of our government, warning that steps should be taken to protect US forces based in Asia. After the story aired, a Pentagon spokesman officially denied the existence of that November report, while various other top level government and intelligence officials refused to comment. But a few days later, Israeli television mentioned that in November American intelligence had indeed shared such a report on the Wuhan disease outbreak with its NATO 
and Israeli allies, thus seeming to independently confirm the complete accuracy of the original ABC News story and its several government sources.
It therefore appears that elements of the Defense Intelligence Agency were aware of the deadly viral outbreak in Wuhan more than a month before any officials in the Chinese government itself. Unless our intelligence agencies have pioneered the technology of precognition, I think this may have happened for the same reason that arsonists have the earliest knowledge of future fires.
According to these multiply-sourced mainstream media accounts, by “the second week of November” our Defense Intelligence Agency was already preparing a secret report warning of a “cataclysmic” disease outbreak taking place in Wuhan. Yet at that point, probably no more than a couple of dozen individuals had been infected in that city of 11 million, with few of those yet having any serious symptoms. The implications are rather obvious. Furthermore:
As the coronavirus gradually began to spread beyond China’s own borders, another development occurred that greatly multiplied my suspicions. Most of these early cases had occurred exactly where one might expect, among the East Asian countries bordering China. But by late February Iran had become the second epicenter of the global outbreak. Even more surprisingly, its political elites had been especially hard-hit, with a full 10% of the entire Iranian parliament soon infected and at least a dozen of its officials and politicians dying of the disease, including some who were quite senior. Indeed, Neocon activists on Twitter began gleefully noting that their hated Iranian enemies were now dropping like flies.
Let us consider the implications of these facts. Across the entire world the only political elites that have yet suffered any significant human losses have been those of Iran, and they died at a very early stage, before significant outbreaks had even occurred almost anywhere else in the world outside China. Thus, we have America assassinating Iran’s top military commander on Jan. 2nd and then just a few weeks later large portions of the Iranian ruling elites became infected by a mysterious and deadly new virus, with many of them soon dying as a consequence. Could any rational individual possibly regard this as a mere coincidence?
The Iranians themselves were well aware of these facts, and their top political and military leaders publicly accused America of an illegal biowarfare attack against their own country and China, with their former president even filing an official protest with the United Nations. But although these explosive charges were widely reported in the Iranian press, they were completely ignored by the American media so that almost no Americans ever became aware of them.

relation or even ou tright alliance during most of the remainder hardly suggest that russians and germans be hereditary enemy moreover during much of that period russia rule elite have have considerable germanic tinge russia legendary catherine the great have be german princess by birth and over the century so many russian ruler have take german wife that the later czar of the romanov dynasty be usually more german than russian russia itself have substantial but heavily assimilate german population which be very well represent in elite political circle with german name be quite common among government minister and sometimes find among important military commander even top leader of the decembrist revolt of the early 19th century have have german ancestry but be zealous russian nationalist in his ideology if the loom economic calamity do eventually shift germany to russian alliance the american attack on the nord stream pipeline will be remember as the blow that alter the entire trajectory of global politic to this point most reader will probably be nod their head at the factual observation have make even if they doubt some of the suggest possible consequence perhaps america destruction of europe energy pipeline and the result economic devastation of germany will lead to permanent rupture in the western alliance or perhaps not the future be difficult to predict but although there be not single shred of hard evidence indicate american involvement the circumstantial case be so overwhelmingly strong that no sensible person can come to any other conclusion whether or not we act through local proxy our government be clearly responsible for the destruction of europe most important energy infrastructure an act of absolutely colossal criminality and recklessness which may have enormously negative consequence for our own national interest virtually all western mainstream medium outlet and many alternative one may scrupulously avoid this reality and pay propagandist may energetically dispute it but it remain the obvious truth and here the rub this entire scenario seem remarkably similar to another that have advance over the last couple of year on an entirely different topic begin in april 2020 have publish long series of article argue that the global covid epidemic be the result of an american biowarfare attack against china and iran just as with president biden donald trump himself be similarly out of the loop but the attack be probably orchestrate by top figure in his administration who immediately try somewhat successfully to blame the chinese for the viral epidemic that begin in their own country once again virtually all of the relevant fact have be ignore by the western medium but can easily be find and connect together and once again the weight of circumstantial evidence seem overwhelming indeed in many respect far strong than that for the pipeline attack during the thirty month have be make this case the only strong argument ever present against it be the claim that not even rogue element of the trump administration could have be so reckless as to launch biowarfare attack an attack whose unintended blowback eventually kill over million americans and disrupt the life of billion worldwide but our destruction of europe most crucial energy infrastructure demonstrate the true depth of the criminal recklessness sometimes find in the american government once individual have fully absorb the broad implication of the nord stream attack include the widespread but ridiculous medium claim that the russians destroy their own pipeline they should reassess their assumption regard american governmental behavior and also reexamine the circumstance of the covid outbreak with fresh eye in particular they should note the strikingly clear evidence of american foreknowledge of the outbreak which can be summarize in just few hundred word for example in 2017 trump bring in robert kadlec who since the 1990s have be one of america lead biowarfare advocate the follow year in 2018 mysterious viral epidemic hit china poultry industry and in 2019 another mysterious viral epidemic devastate china pork industry from the early day of the administration lead trump official have regard china as america most formidable geopolitical adversary and orchestrate policy of confrontation then from january to august 2019 kadlec department run the crimson contagion simulation exercise involve the hypothetical outbreak of dangerous respiratory viral disease in china which eventually spread into the united states with the participant focus on the necessary measure to control it in this country as one of america foremost biowarfare expert kadlec have emphasize the unique effectiveness of bioweapon as far back as the late 1990 and we must commend he for his considerable prescience in having organize major viral epidemic exercise in 2019 that be so remarkably similar to what actually begin in the real world just few month later with lead trump official greatly enamor of biowarfare fiercely hostile to china and run large scale 2019 simulation on the consequence of mysterious viral outbreak in that country it seem entirely unreasonable to completely disregard the possibility that such extremely reckless plan may have be privately discuss and eventually implement though probably without presidential authorization but with the horrific consequence of our own later governmental inaction be obvious element within our intelligence agency have seek to demonstrate that they be not the one asleep at the switch early this month an abc news story cite four separate government source to reveal that as far back as late november special medical intelligence unit within our defense intelligence agency have produce report warn that an out of control disease epidemic be occur in the wuhan area of china and widely distribute that document throughout the top rank of our government warning that step should be take to protect we force base in asia after the story air pentagon spokesman officially deny the existence of that november report while various other top level government and intelligence official refuse to comment but few day later israeli television mention that in november american intelligence have indeed share such report on the wuhan disease outbreak with its nato and israeli ally thus seem to independently confirm the complete accuracy of the original abc news story and its several government source it therefore appear that element of the defense intelligence agency be aware of the deadly viral outbreak in wuhan more than month before any official in the chinese government itself unless our intelligence agency have pioneer the technology of precognition think this may have happen for the same reason that arsonist have the early knowledge of future fire accord to these multiply source mainstream medium account by the second week of november our defense intelligence agency be already prepare secret report warning of cataclysmic disease outbreak take place in wuhan yet at that point probably no more than couple of dozen individual have be infect in that city of 11 million with few of those yet have any serious symptom the implication be rather obvious furthermore as the coronavirus gradually begin to spread beyond china own border another development occur that greatly multiply my suspicion most of these early case have occur exactly where one might expect among the east asian country border china but by late february iran have become the second epicenter of the global outbreak even more surprisingly its political elite have be especially hard hit with full 10 of the entire iranian parliament soon infect and at least dozen of its official and politician die of the disease include some who be quite senior indeed neocon activist on twitter begin gleefully note that their hate iranian enemy be now drop like fly let we consider the implication of these fact across the entire world the only political elite that have yet suffer any significant human loss have be those of iran and they die at very early stage before significant outbreak have even occur almost anywhere else in the world outside china thus we have america assassinate iran top military commander on jan 2nd and then just few week later large portion of the iranian ruling elite became infect by mysterious and deadly new virus with many of they soon die as consequence could any rational individual possibly regard this as mere coincidence the iranians themselves be well aware of these fact and their top political and military leader publicly accuse america of an illegal biowarfare attack against their own country and china with their former president even file an official protest with the united nations but although these explosive charge be widely report in the iranian press they be completely ignore by the american medium so that almost no americans ever become aware of they","[(europe, 'NNP'), (be, 'VB'), (face, 'VB'), (its, 'PRP$'), (bad, 'JJ'), (energy, 'NN'), (crisis, 'NN'), (in, 'IN'), (generation, 'NN'), (with,

17,3125,"Top UN Official . . . ""We Own The Science And The World Should Know It""
","[Everyone should note just how deeply the WEF is embedded in all this. It's certainly NOT a good thing . . . SC]
The UN rep also bragged about how they partnered with Google so only ‘official’ UN Covid and climate talking points would appear in results.
By declaring they ‘own the science,’ partnering with big tech to manipulate search results & pouring millions into media outlets, the unelected globalists are showing their true colors for all to see.
The United Nations’ global communications representative; Melissa Fleming, tells the WEF, “We own the science, and we think that the world should know it, and the platforms themselves also do,” during a panel on disinformation.
During the World Economic Forum’s Sustainable Development Impact Meetings last week, the unelected globalists held a panel on “Tackling Disinformation” where participants from the UN, CNN, and Brown University discussed how to best control narratives.
The Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications at the United Nations highlighted that the UN had partnered with several big tech companies, including TikTok and Google, to control COVID and climate narratives while claiming, “We own the science.”
On the topic of controlling the climate change narrative, Fleming remarked that the UN had partnered with Google, so that the unelected globalists’ authoritative narratives would appear at the top of search results.
“We partnered with Google,” said Fleming, adding, “for example, if you Google ‘climate change,’ you will, at the top of your search, you will get all kinds of UN resources.
“We started this partnership when we were shocked to see that when we Googled ‘climate change,’ we were getting incredibly distorted information right at the top.
“We’re becoming much more proactive. We own the science, and we think that the world should know it, and the platforms themselves also do,” she added.
But the unelected globalists’ efforts on narrative control didn’t end with partnering with Google to manipulate search results on climate change.
Fleming also highlighted that the UN worked with TikTok on a project called “Team Halo” to boost COVID messaging coming from medical and scientific communities on the Chinese-owned video sharing platform.
“We had another trusted messenger project, which was called ‘Team Halo’ where we trained scientists around the world and some doctors on TikTok, and we had TikTok working with us,” she said.
The UN claims to own the science, but if we take a closer look at who funds the UN’s “directing and coordinating authority on international health” — the World Health Organization (WHO) — we get a clearer picture of who is really calling the shots.
Historically, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, along with the Gates-backed GAVI vaccine alliance, have contributed more to the WHO program budget than all member nations, save two — the US and the UK.

18,3142,"Activists sign petitions as at least 10 dead from controversial tradition
","Runners try to avoid bulls as they run down a street during the traditional San Fermin bull run in Pamplona, Spain, on Sunday. The festival, locally known as Sanfermines, is held annually from July 6 to July 14 in commemoration of the city's patron saint. Hundreds of thousands of visitors from all over the world attended the fiesta. 
Spain's controversial bull-running festivals have once again hit the headlines after a deadly summer in which at least 10 people lost their lives, exacerbating divisions over the centuries-old tradition.
Seven deaths occurred in the eastern Valencia region where the practice of releasing bulls into the streets for entertainment has sparked debate, with the other fatalities taking place in the regions of Madrid, Castilla y Leon and Navarra in the north.
The 2022 toll raises to over 30, a total number of people who have been killed in Valencia's bull-running events since 2015.
This summer's victims, who died from injuries sustained while racing through the streets alongside a group of hefty bulls, known as ""bous al carrer"" in Valencian, were between the ages of 18 and 73.
Six of them were men and one was a woman, a French woman who was the oldest victim.
They died after being gored or trampled by the bulls. Countless other people were injured, among them minors.
Bull-running events are a highlight of summer festivities across Spain, with the best known being the San Fermin festival in the northern city of Pamplona.
The idea is that a small group of bulls are let loose into a fenced-off area of the streets and hundreds of foolhardy thrill-seekers run alongside them for a few adrenaline-fuelled minutes, in a spectacle that draws thousands of spectators.
In Valencia and in southern parts of neighboring Catalonia, such events are hugely popular and few are the villages that don't put on some sort of entertainment involving bulls barreling through the streets.
There are also ""bous a la mar,"" races to the seafront where at the end of the run, the participants vie to try and make the bulls fall into the water, most ending up there themselves.
Experts are divided about when the practice of running the bulls began but Cuellar, a town some 150 kilometers north of Madrid, claims to have historical records dating back to the 13th century.
And although the exact origin of the tradition is unclear, it is thought to be emerged out of the need to bring bulls from the countryside into the towns on market day when they would be corralled through the streets with sticks.
Irrespective of how it began, it has become a political hot potato for local authorities, which often sparks heated debate and can win or lose an election.
German Zaragoza, head of the region's Federation of Bull-Fighting Clubs which promotes bull-running events as the Spain's ""most-traditional and authentic"" fiestas, says Valencia's love for the ""bous al carrer"" needs be take on by the politicians.
""And neither the city councils nor the regions have the authority to ban or organize a referendum"" on the fate of such events.
But not all areas of Valencia feel the same, with towns like Sueca or Tavernes de la Valldigna refusing to issue permits for bull-running events in 2022.
And animal welfare associations have published a manifesto calling for a ban, which describes bull-running events as ""torture dressed up as culture and tradition"" in which ""abuse is more than evident.""
Such spectacles often involve ""these noble animals"" being beaten with sticks, kicked, jerked around, insulted, humiliated and subjected to stress, it states.
And the runners ""are often drunk or under the influence of drugs, with many also injured.""
So far, the petition has garnered some 5,500 signatures.

19,3143,"Nearly 8% of people living in San Francisco and Seattle plan to MOVE elsewhere
","Residents in San Francisco and Seattle are more likely to move to a different city as they experience high crime rate and homelessness, according to a new survey.
For the first time ever, the American Housing Survey asked residents in the nation’s 15 major cities if they planned on moving, with many Dem-led cities leading the way in the looming exodus.
About 7.6 percent of those in San Francisco said they wanted to move to a different city, with Seattle coming in second at 7.2 percent.
Following them was Washington D.C and Detroit, who both reported that 6.8 percent of residents wished to move away, with Detroit coming in fifth at 6.6 percent.
New York City appeared to have the most content residents out of the bunch, with only 3.2 percent saying they wished to move to another city. Both Phoenix and Philadelphia followed behind with 3.7 percent.
San Francisco’s problems began to inflate in 2019, with the pandemic only making things worse for the Golden Gate City.
According to the latest available FBI Unified Crime Report, San Francisco had the highest overall crime rate of the 20 largest cities in the United States, recording 6,917 crimes per 100,000 population in 2019.
That was more than double the crime rates in New York and Los Angeles, and well above the rates in the next largest US cities: Chicago, Houston, and Phoenix.
A year later following the Black Lives Matter protests, the call to defund the police grew among Democratic leaders.
San Francisco Mayor London Breed demanded cities defund the police last year, announcing that the Golden Gate City would be one of the first to do so and promising to slice $120million from the budgets of its police and sheriff’s departments.

20,3141,"China marks a milestone in new-gen heavy-duty rocket devt with successful engine test
","The closed expander cycle hydrogen-oxygen rocket engine's first thrust chamber extrusion test in December 2021.
China has successfully conducted a whole-craft running test for its 25 ton-level closed expander cycle hydrogen-oxygen rocket engine for the first time recently, which its developers claimed marked the world's largest scale testing for the kind and a key technology breakthrough for the country's development of the new-generation super heavy-lift launch vehicle.
The CASC revealed on its official website in December 2021 that the closed expander cycle hydrogen-oxygen rocket engine system has the advantages of high performance and high reliability, and has the ability of multiple starts and of large-scale variable thrust adjustment.
It can be used for complex space missions such as manned moon landing, manned Mars landing and deep space exploration, according to the CASC.
According to the CASC, the new engine, the most powerful one of its kind worldwide, is three times stronger than the ones currently deployed for the upper stage of Chinese rocket in active service, and reaches a world leading class. It is a landmark product that China has advanced to the world space power.
When reached by the Global Times on Tuesday, the engine developers with the Sixth Academy of the state-owned aerospace giant China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), declined to provide further details of the new engine model and no video footage is available to show the test process. However, space observers speculated that the new engine system is likely to be used as the third stage and upper stage for the country's highly anticipated Long March-9 super heavy-lift rocket, which would boost China's future space endeavors in the fields including manned Moon and Mars landing, among other deep space exploration programs.
A space expert, who asked not to be named, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the exciting 25-ton engine being tested could be the YF-79 engines, which is even more powerful than the current YF-75D engine atop the Long March-5 - the strongest Chinese launch vehicle to date.
Four such YF-79 engines working in a group to constitute the third stage for the Long March-9 heavy duty vehicle, providing a thrust of some 100 tons, the expert noted.
So far, China has announced a successful running test for its domestically developed 500-ton level liquid-oxygen kerosene rocket engine, which is speculated to be codenamed the YF-130 rocket engine with a 50 percent rated working condition in March 2021; and the completion of the development of a prototype for the 220-ton YF-90 oxygen-hydrogen rocket engine in July 2021, according to media reports.
Space observers said that it seems that the YF-130 rocket engine for the Long March-9 vehicle's first stage, the YF-90 engine for the second stage, and now the YF-79 rocket engine for the third and upper stage have all achieved major development breakthroughs. China is moving closer to the final completion of the heavy-duty launch vehicle which will help the country to develop to be a world space power.
According to what Jiang Jie, the chief designer with the China Academy of Launch Vehicle who is also a China Academy of Sciences academician, has said in March, the development of the super heavy-lift which is of epoch-making significance, would take eight to 10 years.
Space observers noted that according to all the information gathered, the maiden flight for the new generation super heavy-lift vehicle could be expected within the next five year plan of 2026 to 30.

21,3140,"Report: 76% of Border Crossers Bused to NYC Remain in Homeless Shelters
","The overwhelming majority of border crossers and illegal aliens sent to the sanctuary city of New York City are still in the city’s homeless shelter system after having arrived on migrant buses sent by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R).
For months, Abbott has been busing border crossers and illegal aliens to New York City as well as the sanctuary jurisdictions of Washington, DC, and Chicago, Illinois. Texas, in the process, is saving billions by punting illegal immigration to other cities and states that pride themselves on providing sanctuary to illegal aliens.
The most recent figures, published by The City, reveal that of the more than 15,500 border crossers and illegal aliens who have entered New York City’s homeless shelter system, more than 11,800, or about 76 percent, remain in shelters.
Likewise, those leaving the homeless shelter system often do so with the help of taxpayer money from New Yorkers.
The City reports that in fiscal year 2021, just 1,800 single adults and over a thousand families exited the homeless shelter system without needing taxpayer-funded housing subsidies. Meanwhile, more than 5,200 single adults and about 4,120 families left the shelters with taxpayer-funded subsidies to provide them housing.
As Breitbart News reported in August, New York Times analysis found that “the situation is dire” for the city’s overcrowded homeless shelter system where, if the pace of border crossers and illegal aliens bused to New York City continues, the family homeless shelter population “would nearly double, to almost 60,000, up from the current 31,000” over the next year.
Last week, reports circulated that Mayor Eric Adams (D) and Democrat politicians are asking American taxpayers to hand over about $500 million in federal aid to help house border crossers and illegal aliens being bused from Texas.
Mass immigration helps drive up the cost of housing and rent, years of research shows.
A 2017 study published in the Journal of Housing Economics found that “increases in immigration into a metropolitan statistical area are linked with rising rents and home prices in that metropolitan statistical area and neighboring metropolitan statistical areas.”
The latest housing cost figures in New York City reveal that the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment has jumped almost 40 percent since the same time last year, and rent for two-bedroom apartments has increased more than 46 percent.
The sky-high rent hikes come as the Biden administration’s expansive Catch and Release network has increased the number of border crossers and illegal aliens sent to New York City on the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program by 184 percent since 2020.",report 76 of border crosser bus to nyc remain in homeless shelter,"[(report, 'VB'), (76, 'CD'), (of, 'IN'), (border, 'NN'), (crosser, 'NN'),

22,3154,"Oh Thank God, Banksy Is In Ukraine
","The war in Ukraine is, to put it lightly, a deep and absolute nightmare both in the loss of human life and the relentless, constant updates of the newest nightmare Russia has cooked up. And just in case that wasn’t quite enough to cause a dull sense of compounding doom squarely behind your forehead, we now have news that stray Russian missiles have hit and killed civilians in Poland, just to really make sure everyone in the world is on pins and needles. Thankfully, the one thing that could possibly untangle the violent Gordian knot that is the Ukraine conflict has finally arrived: Banksy is in Ukraine.
Street artist Banksy, the modern-day philosopher responsible for such revolutionary statements as “if guns were flowers the world would be a nicer place,” is apparently in the country. Sure, your family and friends are in constant mortal danger if not already deceased, but now, Ukrainians, you have the chance to change your perspective through political art with the depth of cheesecloth. Banksy is here to open the world’s eyes, with a couple of spray cans and the critical thinking of a political meme screenshotted onto your aunt’s phone from a facebook group.
Wipe the soot from your eyes, downtrodden masses of Ukraine, and behold the thing that will bring you back to the light: a picture of a ballerina. Don’t you see? Even though that building is destroyed, likely along with anyone you know who might have been in the vicinity… something something ballet. Look, I know we all loved Banksy for a while. Coincidentally, we were all in high school for a while. It was also during an era where political art had to do almost no heavy lifting at all, versus the napalm-laden spiderweb that the political sphere is now. Spraypainting a picture of a girl holding balloons on a bomb shelter feels a little less necessary when the bomb shelter is full of actual little girls.
I do have one recommendation for how this could actually help a population at war, however. If you live in Ukraine, and see some stenciled picture of a crying bomb or whatever near you, chisel that shit out and flip it at Sotheby’s for some tech CEO’s living room. That should give you a couple mil to spend on plate carriers so your relatives can stay alive.",oh thank god banksy be in ukraine,"[(oh, 'UH'), (thank, 'VBP'), (god, 'NNP'), (banksy, 'NN'), (be,

23,3150,"35-Year-Old Man Sues His Mother After Being Evicted From Basement Of Her Home
","Duane Hollingsworth shuffles around the cramped confines of his temporary home–a tiny 5th wheel trailer filled with boxes containing clothes, personal effects, and other meager belongings. After spending his entire life dwelling in the basement of his mother’s home, she had finally become fed up with her unmotivated son and gave Hollingsworth the boot.
The unemployed 35-year-old who has never lived on his own was clearly distressed when I spoke with him Wednesday. “She’s destroyed my life”, he exclaimed bitterly, staring at the photo in his clenched fist; A photograph of his family during happier times.
Duane has 3 younger siblings who have since gone on with their lives and become successful, driven adults, but Duane’s life just never seemed to take off. He remained content with frittering away his days playing video games and watching anime cartoons; Things that are mostly enjoyed by children. Duane is an adult male who just absolutely refuses to grow up.
After the death of Duane’s father 2 years ago, his mother Janice gave him an ultimatum: Either get a full-time job, enroll in college, or find somewhere else to live. After a handful of paltry attempts to secure employment at various fast-food establishments, it was clear that Duane would rather spend his time nestled among My Little Pony figurines in a musky basement than actually work for a living.
“It was clear he wasn’t serious about making a living for himself”, Janice explained. “He always had some excuse and frankly all these excuses were wearing very thin. I just wanted him out so I could enjoy retirement after having lost my husband. He was becoming an enormous financial burden and didn’t seem to care. Duane wouldn’t budge. He would frequently lash out and blame his siblings and myself for his lot in life.”
Eventually the moment of reckoning finally arrived in January of this year. Janice gave Duane 30 days to find somewhere else to live. “It was 30 days of pure hell. He stormed around the house screaming and crying. I could not believe what a spoiled brat he was at 35 years years of age! He always resented me for having more children after he was born. I suppose he just thought he would be the baby forever, but that clearly is not a healthy way for an adult to live.”
Duane finally found a tiny trailer for rent on the outskirts of town. He is currently supporting himself by selling off his vintage action figures and other collectibles on Ebay and pawning items for loans at Eksperten. He has also began taking steps to sue his own mother for damages, pain and suffering, emotional trauma and illegal eviction, all to the tune of 750k.
“I have PTSD now”, he exclaimed during our short interview. Duane sat across from me looking distressed and disheveled, wearing grimy gray sweatpants and a threadbare Power Rangers t-shirt which was clearly too small for his hulking frame. “My mother is going to pay for kicking me out! I had squatter’s rights! That was my lifelong home and my mother did nothing but torture me the whole time I was there! My parents neglected me when my other siblings were born so I totally deserve to stay there as long as I want! Nobody knows the hell I have endured!”
When questioned about the impending lawsuit being served up by her own son, Janice just shakes her head. “He only has himself to blame for his situation and obviously, he’s going to lose. Our only crime was being too nice and enabling this sort of behavior. Unfortunately, by coddling a weakling for far too long, I created a monster.”

24,3144,"Energy Crisis Driving Up Cremation Costs in France, Reports Suggest
","Soaring energy prices have been driving up costs for cremation in France, with prices expected to rise by more than a third next year, media reported on Thursday.
French news channel BFMTV cited estimates of funeral cost tracking service MPF which show that the price of gas accounts for 15% to 25% of the funeral price.
Cremation costs may reportedly rise 35% next year to the average 911 euros ($887).
Cremation costs ranged between 605 and 675 euros before energy shortages became a problem.
Cremation has until recently been a cheaper alternative to a burial but large funeral firms, which are not eligible for energy subsidies, are expected to pass the bills for the soaring gas prices on to the bereaved.

25,3145,"Meta Added to Russia’s List of ‘Extremist and Terrorist’ Organizations
","Russia’s federal service for financial monitoring, Rosfinmonitoring, has declared Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, formerly known as Facebook, a “terrorist and extremist” organization. The news was confirmed in an update on the service’s website on Tuesday.
Meta Platforms Inc, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, was labeled an extremist organization back in March by a decree of Moscow’s Tverskoy Court following a request from Russia’s General Prosecutor’s office.
All of Meta’s activities and services, with the exception of WhatsApp, have since been banned in Russia as the US-based tech giant was accused of “extremist activity” for allowing hate speech directed toward Russian nationals on its platforms and refusing to remove what Moscow considered false content about the conflict in Ukraine.
With Rosfinmonitoring’s decision, Russian banks are now also obliged to freeze all of the tech giant’s assets and suspend all services to accounts belonging to it or individuals associated with it.
Meta has denied allegations of allowing Russophobia on its platforms, insisting the decision to ease hate speech restrictions against Russian nationals was temporary and implemented only in certain regions, such as Ukraine and Poland, so that people could vent their anger over the conflict. The company tried to file an appeal of the court’s decision, but it was ultimately rejected.
While Facebook and Instagram are officially banned in Russia and inaccessible without a VPN, there are currently no punishments for Russian citizens who use the services or post legal content on them.

26,3151,"Opinion: America brought back Fascism, so what now?
","The past four years have been a disaster and unfortunately answered “how did the Germans let Hitler come to power?” It took this long for “the Great American Experiment” to surprise us all with the rise of extreme nationalism and fascism within our borders.
Initially, I was not surprised, since growing up I learned a quote from George Santayana, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Many in our nation recreated the past with new buzzwords and villains, while those knowledgeable of the past warned of the repercussions.
However, this did not happen by accident. Those causing this change knew their history, actively made these decisions, and most importantly were in positions with the wealth and power to influence people. Those with this wealth and power could use it to build theme parks or revive bad move franchises, but they choose to do this instead. Understanding that I believe that Santayana’s quote should be updated to “Those who cannot remember the past will be forced to repeat it by those in control who remember.”
The knowledge of the past by those with influence is not always a tragedy waiting in the wings. By holding those in power accountable to act in preventing the repeating of the past failings of man, we can continue to move towards the future. Santayana’s quote can again be revised to “Those who cannot remember the past can be condemned to relive it if the powerful choose to recreate it.”
Ultimately, the common person will not have the power or influence to cause/stop history repeating. However, we as individuals have the ability to choose to know the history and prevent our actions from being scrutinized by future generations.
Those with money, power, and influence have the ability and need to be held accountable to make these changes for the betterment of society. An example is executives at Fox should bring back Firefly. With the success of the Mandolorian, sci-fi westerns with a found family trope is a hot market and could revive your failing network. Don’t repeat the past mistakes of messing up the air order, bad marketing, helping the rise of fascism through your news network, and please retcon Wash’s death. These actions can help the future.

27,3147,"Solar Panels Drain the Sun’s Energy, Experts Say
","This week, a scientific research facility in Wyoming made a startling discovery that is certain to change the way millions of Americans look at the environmentalism movement, after they found conclusive evidence that solar panels not only convert the sun’s energy into usable energy, but that they are also draining the sun of its own energy, possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming.
Scientists at the Wyoming Institute of Technology, a privately-owned think tank located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, discovered that energy radiated from the sun isn’t merely captured in solar panels, but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels, in a process they refer to as “forced photovoltaic drainage.”
“Put into laymen’s terms, the solar panels capture the sun’s energy, but pull on the sun over time, forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing,” WIT claims in a scientific white paper published on Wednesday. “Imagine a waterfall, dumping water. But you aren’t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, you’re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.”
WIT is adamant that there’s no immediate danger, however. “Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we’d start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.”
The study was commissioned in August 2011 by the Halliburton corporation, who wanted to learn if the energy giant should start manufacturing and selling solar panels domestically and internationally. Halliburton’s executives wanted to know more about the sustainability of solar energy and how photovoltaic technology might evolve over the next ten years. But based on the findings of WIT’s research in the field, Halliburton revealed on Friday that they will not be entering the solar energy market.
“Solar panels destroying the sun could potentially be the worst man-made climate disaster in the history of the world, and Halliburton will not be taking part in that,” the company stated in a press release issued Friday morning. “It’s obvious, based on the findings of this neutral scientific research group, that humans needs to become more dependent on fossil fuels like oil and coal, not less. Because these so-called `green technologies’ are far more dangerous to the Earth than any hydrofracking operation or deep-water drilling station. What good is clean air when our very sun is no longer functional?”

“We’ve digitally removed him from footage of parliament, replaced him with Piers Morgan for the referendum campaign on the basis that one inexplicably popular twat journalist is as good as another, and burned his Churchill book. It was remaindered anyway.
“What’s helping us is that the public have really embraced the project. They don’t want to remember and they’re eager to pretend it never happened. Especially if they voted for him.”

29,319,"The GOP War Against LGBTQ
","“Let It Be”
– Paul McCartney, 1970
There’s a pervasive and perverted sickness in the land, and I don’t mean the opioid crisis or the coronavirus pandemic.
I’m referring to the Republican preoccupation and obsession with LGBTQ folks despite their acceptance by a majority of Americans, with GOP-led states recently passing laws to keep transgender girls and women from competing in sports.
This right-wing entity, controlled by a restrictive ideology and led by someone who shamelessly refuses to acknowledge he lost a presidential election, bears no resemblance to a sane political party. It is taking the entire country down with it, back to the 1950s.
Overall, the ‘50s were a quieter, perhaps more civilized time without a cacophonous social media despite a tough beginning with a war in Korea and some rough times with the Communist scare of the McCarthy era, the Suez crisis, the Hungarian Revolution and the Soviet Union’s subsequent invasion of Hungary and President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s deployment of active-duty military to force the integration of a high school in Little Rock, Ark.
But there was even a darker side to those times, when racism was blatant, when gays, bisexuals, transgender people and others who weren’t heterosexual were bullied, ridiculed and scorned. It took generations, but we’ve matured with laws that legalize same-sex marriage, abortion and ensuring more equality for women, Blacks and other people of color.
We even have a presidential cabinet officer, Transportation Secretary Peter Buttigieg, who not only is openly gay but is married to another man and ran for president in 2020. And we’re about to have the first Black woman justice of the Supreme Court. That’s monumental progress.
Fully 7.1 percent of American adults identify as LGBTQ, a record, up from 5.6 percent in 2020, according to a Gallup poll released in February. Bisexuality is the most common trait, it said. Gen Zers, those born between 1997 and 2003 who have reached adulthood, are the largest proportion of LGBTQ people at 21 percent, the poll said. That generation includes 65 million Americans.
“They’ve really grown up in a culture where being LGBT was normal and not something that people had to be embarrassed about or try and hide,” Jeffrey Jones, a Gallup senior editor, told The Washington Post.
Among millennials, 10.5 percent self-identify as LGBTQ, the poll said. That generation, born between 1981 and 1996, has a population of 56.3 million.
Yet “across the country, extremist anti-LGBTQI+ and anti-transgender groups are waging a coordinated campaign to restrict LGBTQI+ rights and target transgender youth specifically,” according to the Equality Federation, a partner with the Center for American Progress (CAP), a nonpartisan policy group. The “I” is for intersex, someone born with both male and female traits.
“Nearly 400 anti-LGBTQI+ bills were introduced across the country in 2021,” CAP reported. “In 2022, state legislatures are currently considering approximately 300 anti-LGBTQI+ bills.”
Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah and others, it said, enacted such bills this year. Further, 14 states ban “transgender students from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity.” Four have outlawed or restricted access “to medically necessary, best-practice gender-affirming care for transgender youth.
“These anti-LGBTQI+ attacks endanger the fundamental rights and well-being of LGBTQI+ communities,” CAP said.
Far-right Republicans, who have become the White Taliban of the West as they set an extremist agenda alien to many Americans, is staining and trying to stamp out the progress we’ve made publicly to put the human in human rights, to make people feel accepted who have been pilloried just for being how their maker made them. They are innocent of their own creation; they are not to blame for who they are.
It’s all part of a culture war theme intended to attract the conservative vote. It includes damning books, unilaterally ridding schools and libraries of reading materials that have been accepted for decades just because some people who don’t even have library cards think they don’t belong in the hands of children.
So, it is with abortion and forbidding the right of a woman to decide what’s good for herself, which this country resolved, I thought, 49 years ago with Roe v. Wade. Now it’s becoming an endangered species as more and more Republican-led states restrict abortion. There’s concern the majority conservative Supreme Court is about to do the same.
And now it’s sex and gender mixed with schools and education – a volatile arena – that have been tagged form attacks in a campaign for so-called “parental rights,” a misnomer if ever there was one. It certainly doesn’t include all parents, certainly not those who want their children to be exposed to all aspects of life, in the classroom as well as at home. It’s called growing up.
But instead of a healthy, serious nationwide adult debate about the ramifications of discussing subjects of a sexual nature and gender identity in schools, we get this nonsensical juvenile nonsense from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., that’s right out of the QAnon conspiracy handbook:
“The Democrats are the party of pedophiles,” she said in an interview she put on Twitter, which belongs in a dumpster. “The Democrats are the party of princess predators from Disney. The Democrats are the party of elementary school teachers trying to transition their elementary school-aged children and convince them they’re a different gender. This is the party of their identity, and their identity is the most disgusting, evil, horrible things happening in our country.”
Why would any teacher in any grade want to change the gender identity of any child? Why is Greene in Congress, giving her a once-highly respected platform to spout ridiculous crap, dragging it through mud?
I wanted to focus on LGBTQ folks because what the right-wingers are doing adversely affects kids, the people who are coming of age, who are wrestling with who they are, who deserve every break they can get so they can, as the Army once put it, “be all you can be.” That’s not just an empty slogan. To me, it means being at peace with yourself.
The introduction of anti-LGBTQI+ legislation “alone – and the often hateful, dehumanizing, and misinformed debates that surround them – causes concrete harm to LGBTQI+ people, especially youth, by exacerbating existing mental health disparities,” CAP said in a report on this year’s outlook for LGBTQI+ rights.
It’s difficult to be at peace with yourself, regardless of who you are. LGBTQI+ folks have it hard enough. Politicians should let them be in the hands, hearts and minds of loving family, friends and knowledgeable teachers and therapists who know how to “whisper words of wisdom” to those who feel different from the gender they were born with.
It’s their job, their calling, their expertise, not grist for the political mill.
“This is a political wedge issue and an attempt to win a culture war,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said about recent Republican anti-LGBTQ legislation during a recent podcast interview, the Post reported. “And they’re doing that in a way that is harsh and cruel to a community of kids.
“I’m going to get emotional about this issue, because it’s horrible. But it’s like kids who are bullied, and all these leaders are taking steps to hurt them and hurt their lives and hurt their families.”
To help LGBTQI+ folks, the Senate should pass the Equality Act, which the House adopted Feb. 25, 2021.
It amends the 1964 Civil Rights Act to prohibit “discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity in areas including public accommodations and facilities, education, federal funding, employment, housing, credit and the jury system,” according to Congress.gov.
Further, the bill “prohibits an individual from being denied access to a shared facility, including a restroom, a locker room, and a dressing room, that is in accordance with the individual’s gender identity,” it states.
We live in a democracy, a self-governing free society that is dedicated, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, to equality and to “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
The Senate could do no better than to endorse those words by passing the Equality Act. Kids ask a million questions, rightfully so. They deserve straightforward answers.

30,318,"‘Silent No More’: The Story That Must Be Told About The ‘Covid’ Vaccine In New Zealand
","This is a question that can only really be answered if the full truth and the full evidence is known and assessed by the people of New Zealand. Thankfully that may be beginning to happen now. But one thing is for certain. The biggest victims of this situation are now coming together, they are uniting to support each other, they are uniting to tell their stories, and they will be SILENT NO MORE.
An important point to note here. This is not an anti-vax story at all, and the information presented here is not anti-vax in any way. This is simply information and evidence about one particular vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine.
On March 29th the ‘Silent No More’ movement was officially born in New Zealand. It was an event that was created out of a collective vision and a collective effort of numerous passionate Kiwis from around the country who all had a shared desire and need to come together to tell their story and to just be heard. People from right across the country gathered in front of parliament in a memorial service to grieve together, to tell their stories together, and to deliver their petition with 12,000 signatures (gathered in just 5 days) to parliament.
Some were grieving for the health that they, and so many fellow Kiwis, have now lost. Many permanently. Some were grieving for their loved ones who have paid the ultimate price from taking the COVID-19 vaccine. All were grieving for what has been done collectively to their country and its people. There were tears. A lot of tears. But it was a watershed moment for these people, and for the thousands of others who couldn’t be there but wanted to. No longer would they be hushed up, ignored, and ridiculed by their government and the media.

31,3152,"Bolsonaro won't condemn Putin, says Brazil will remain neutral over invasion
","RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Sunday declined to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, while departing from his government's official stance at the United Nations to say Brazil would remain neutral.
Bolsonaro, a far-right populist, recently snubbed U.S. entreaties not to visit Putin in Moscow ahead of the invasion, and angered Western allies by saying he was ""in solidarity with Russia,"" without elaborating.
On Friday, Brazil voted for a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would have denounced the Russian invasion of Ukraine, despite reluctance by Bolsonaro. Russia vetoed the resolution.
At a press conference, Bolsonaro said he spoke for two hours with Putin. In a subsequent statement, the country's foreign ministry said Bolsonaro did not speak with Putin on Sunday, but was instead referring to his conversation with the Russian leader in Moscow.
In Sunday's press conference, Bolsonaro said Brazil will remain neutral in the conflict, noting Russia and Ukraine were ""practically brother nations.""
""We will not take sides, we will continue being neutral, and help with whatever is possible,"" Bolsonaro said. ""A big part of Ukraine's population speaks Russian.""
Asked by a reporter whether he was willing to condemn Putin's actions, he said he would wait for a final report, or see how the situation is resolved, before giving his opinion.
He added that he was against any sanctions that could bring negative repercussions for Brazil, citing Russian fertilizers which are crucial for the country's giant agribusiness sector.
Bolsonaro also said he did not think Putin's forces would carry out any mass bloodletting in Ukraine.
""A chief of state like that of Russia does not want to undertake a massacre, anywhere,"" he said, adding that in two southern regions of Ukraine, some 90% of the population wanted to ""approximate themselves to Russia.""
In reference to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Bolsonaro said Ukrainians have ""placed the hope of their nation in the hands of a comedian.""
On Saturday, Bolsonaro tweeted his government would not cease in efforts to evacuate Brazilians from Ukraine.
""I ask all Brazilians in contested territory to stay firm, follow instructions and report any incidents to us. I know about the difficulties, but we won't spare any efforts to solve them,"" Bolsonaro wrote on Twitter.
On Sunday, Bolsonaro said his government had so far managed to remove some 70 Brazilians from Ukraine.

32,3146,"US sets free over 300,000 illegal migrants with tracking devices – reports
","President Joe Biden’s administration has reportedly vastly expanded use of a program that sets loose illegal aliens into the US, who are then monitored via phones and tracking devices while their immigration applications are being processed.
There were 316,700 migrants enrolled in the government’s so-called Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program as of September 24, up 266% from when Biden took office in January 2021, according to US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data. The figures, which were obtained by a data-gathering group at Syracuse University and first reported by the Daily Caller, showed that the number of aliens enrolled in the ATD program had never before exceeded 300,000 until last month and had never topped 200,000 until last March.
The program, which costs $2.2 billion annually, is billed as a way to free up detention space while ensuring that migrants show up in court for a hearing of their immigration cases. However, with the country’s immigration courts backed up and overwhelmed by surging migrant traffic at the US-Mexico border, most participants are removed from the ATD program before their cases are concluded. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report last June showed that about a quarter of applicants who are removed from ATD flee from immigration enforcement rather than showing up for their court hearings and likely getting deported.
With two months remaining in the government’s fiscal year, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers had reportedly apprehended more than two million illegal aliens at the southern border as of the end of August, a record high. There were reportedly around 220,000 more crossings in September, a monthly record.
The technology used to track migrants in the ATD program, such as GPS devices, costs taxpayers more than $361,000 a day, on average, according to DHS figures. The GAO said that DHS hasn’t provided complete data on the number of illegal aliens who abscond from the system and can’t be located.
The department announced an additional ATD initiative in June, a pilot program that provides funding to not-for-profit groups and local governments to give migrants such services as mental health care, legal orientation and cultural orientation. For those ATD participants who wind up being deported to their home countries, the pilot program provides “departure planning and reintegration services.”

33,315,"How many and who is dying for ‘our freedom’? 
","Whether the Ukrainian troops, who have been exposed to Russian attacks in their defensive positions for months now, see things the same way is open to debate. According to a number of reliable sources, they have suffered heavy losses of men and material.
Strangely enough, little or nothing is heard about this in the leading media outlets or from politicians. On the other hand, huge Russian losses are reported or speculated about with fervour, the Russian military leadership is alternately accused of incompetence or brutality, and every report from Kiev that signals a new Putin debacle is spread without hesitation. This has already aroused the mistaken hope among some contemporaries in the West that the Ukrainian comedian and his followers are well on the way to a victorious peace over the invaders.
There is a pronounced multimedia-supported lack of interest in Ukrainian military victims, even though they are supposedly allowing themselves to be shot dead or invalided for our “Western values”, for “freedom” and “democracy”. Therefore, not a word has been written about the latest bloody Kiev disaster in the failed recapture of the strategically important Snake Island in the Black Sea off Odessa. Or the fact that more and more completely inadequately militarily trained conscripted Ukrainians and mercenaries are being sent to the Eastern Front as cannon fodder to make up for the large crew losses there.
The total lack of empathy of the “value-based West” with the real suffering and dying Ukrainian soldiers is nothing short of scandalous and profoundly inhumane. As little as there was real interest in the West in the corrupt state of Ukraine before the war, so little interest is there now in the men who are now not only fighting for the independence of their country with weapons, but are supposed to weaken Russia and Putin to the maximum for the benefit of Joe Biden’s family and the tone-deaf clique in Brussels. It makes no sense for Ukrainian soldiers to risk their lives for this rag-tag bunch of deeply unpopular, self-anointed “leaders”. Their own people despise them.
The silence about the military victims of Ukraine results not least from the guilty conscience of those who unscrupulously let many young men die in supplying deadly weapons to “ruin” the much-maligned Vladimir Putin. Western “leaders” and their servants deserve only contempt and shame.
More young men face annihilation after Biden escalated the US proxy war with Russia by signing the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act into law this week, aimed at providing Ukraine with weapons on demand. They now risk triggering a global nuclear demolition for “our values”. How demented is that?
And corporate elites and political puppets like Biden drone on about the threat of “disinformation” but what they actually fear is dissent, not disinformation. They happen to be the top conveyers of untruths, actually. Not long ago, the same people claimed that the fact that the vaccinated can still contract and die from Covid was called disinformation, for example. Biden’s new disinformation Gauleiter Nina Jankowicz thinks “trustworthy verified people” like herself who had recently brazenly lied about Hunter Biden’s laptop, be given the power to turn Twitter into another heavily-redacted Wikipedia.
At least Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene from Georgia is not buying this crap about “our values”: She tore into the bill to provide Ukraine with an astonishing $40 billion military and economic aid and called a spade a spade: “Stop funding regime change and money laundering scams!” She also pointed out that some pro-war US politicians were more interested in covering up their crimes in Ukraine than coming clean.

34,314,"E.U. leaders happy to pose with Zelensky, hesitant on Ukraine membership
","BRUSSELS — Ukraine is one of us. It is marching toward a European future. The future of Europe is, in fact, the future of Ukraine.
These are the messages top European Union officials have delivered since Russia launched its full-scale invasion and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pleaded for a fast track to membership. But ahead of an E.U. summit on the issue this month, these messages look increasingly at odds with where member states actually stand.
It is not yet clear if the 27 E.U. countries will grant Ukraine “candidate status” — an early step on the long path to membership — or some sort of symbolic pre-candidate status, diplomats said. What seems certain is that Ukraine, as it fights for its life, will be let down.
While several E.U. officials, lawmakers and leaders have pressed to expedite Kyiv’s bid, others have tried to temper Ukrainian expectations, stressing that membership might be decades away. In private conversations, some E.U. diplomats conceded that their governments are nervous about starting the accession process with a country at war. A few wondered if Ukraine had a shot at joining at all.
Zelensky on Friday urged the E.U. to pull his country out of the gray area between Europe and Russia. Granting Ukraine candidate status would “prove that words about the longing of the Ukrainian people to be a part of the European family are not just words,” he said in a virtual address to the Copenhagen Democracy Summit.
The gap between the full-throated support from top E.U. officials as they pose for pictures with Zelensky and the quiet skepticism of many E.U. diplomats hangs over preparations for the bloc’s June 23-24 summit — and has not gone unnoticed by Kyiv.
“None of the 27 would say right in the face of the president ‘no,’ but what is happening behind the scenes is clear willingness to put obstacles into the process,” Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine, said on a visit to Brussels.
If it joined, Ukraine would become the fifth-most-populous E.U. nation, and also by far the poorest, drawing subsidies from the rest of the bloc. Its per capita gross domestic product last year was $4,872. The current poorest E.U. country, Bulgaria, stood at $11,683, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund.
The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, is expected to deliver a recommendation on Ukraine’s status next week. E.U. diplomats said the commission may recommend candidate status but with conditions attached — a compromise unlikely to please Ukraine.
Since the decision is ultimately up to member states, Stefanishyna and other Ukrainian officials have been touring European capitals to make the case that Ukraine needs and deserves candidate status without conditions. “The starting point for any discussion is the legal status of Ukraine,” she said.
The debate about Ukraine’s bid threatens to open a split between the country and its European backers, dealing a blow to Kyiv’s aspirations to break free from Russia’s grasp and integrate more tightly with its neighbors to the west.
It also risks further fracturing European unity on assistance for Ukraine, exacerbating tensions between central European countries and Baltic states, on one side, which support Ukraine’s “swift candidacy to the E.U.,” and Western Europeans, who tend to harbor more reservations about Ukraine’s readiness.
“This is a country at war, and they need a morale boost,” Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said in an interview. “I can imagine what the Russian propaganda is going to do with it.”
Witold Waszczykowski, a former Polish foreign minister who is now a member of the European Parliament, said the E.U. must do whatever it can for Ukraine, including granting candidate status. “We understand that we are next,” he said. “If Ukraine collapses, Russia will be the winner and it will go further west.”
Stefanishyna said Ukrainian officials are working to persuade the holdouts, including “some Nordic countries,” the Netherlands and Germany.
In a visit to Kyiv last month, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stressed that there is “no shortcut” to membership. Privately, German leaders have expressed concern that if they open membership talks with Ukraine now, Zelensky by August will be demanding to be let in immediately, though the process typically takes years, officials familiar with their position said. But the German government has not offered an official view on whether Ukraine should be offered candidate status soon.
“The formal position of Germany is that they don’t have a formal position so far,” Stefanishyna said. “We treat that as a positive signal.”
Joining the E.U. is grindingly complex. A prospective member’s entire body of laws must be picked over and brought into compliance with standards set in Brussels.
The bloc is also well aware that it has far more leverage before a country joins than afterward. Once a country is in, it’s much harder to influence democratic commitments — as backsliding among some E.U. members has made clear.
For Ukraine, decades of corruption present a problem. The country ranked 122 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s 2021 corruption perceptions index. Though Ukrainian leaders stress progress on this front, several E.U. diplomats said their governments remain concerned.
“Ukraine wasn’t close before and it is not close now,” said one E.U. diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. “But if enlargement is not a direct option, what do you do?”
In a speech to mark Europe Day last month, French President Emmanuel Macron tried to answer that question, sketching his vision of a “European Political Community” that would include an outer circle of democracies that want to be part of the E.U. — like Ukraine, and even Britain after it chose to leave.
“We feel in our heart that Ukraine, through its fight and its courage, is already today a member of our Europe, of our family and of our union,” Macron said.
“We all know perfectly well that the process allowing them to join would take several years — in truth, probably several decades,” he continued. “That is the truth, unless we decide to lower the standards of this accession and therefore completely rethink the unity of our Europe.”
Macron’s proposal hasn’t received a warm reaction within the E.U. And Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba rejected it outright. He called out unnamed E.U. capitals, saying their strategic ambiguity on Ukraine’s status has “emboldened Putin.”
“We do not need surrogates for EU candidate status that show second-class treatment of Ukraine and hurt feelings of Ukrainians,” he tweeted.
Enlargement skeptics are quick to point out that other countries are ahead in line. Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Albania and Bosnia have all been in membership talks with the E.U. for years. Turkey applied in 1987 and formally remains a candidate, even if it has largely given up.
Some policymakers and diplomats acknowledge that Ukraine stands apart because of the urgency of its situation. But they still are leery of alienating countries that applied earlier.
Ukraine has been pushing for years to further integrate with the E.U., and a free-trade agreement is already in place. But it formally applied for membership on Feb. 28, four days after Russia’s invasion.
On March 1, Zelensky delivered a virtual address to an extraordinary session of the European Parliament. Speaking from a bunker in Kyiv as Russian forces pressed into Ukraine, he said his country was not only fighting for “survival” but “also to be equal members of Europe.”
“Prove that you are with us,” he challenged.
The speech landed with force. An E.U. interpreter was so moved by Zelensky’s evocation of the shelling of Kharkiv that he momentarily lost his composure. By the time the Ukrainian president finished speaking, the audience was on its feet.
At a March summit in Versailles, outside Paris, E.U. leaders were more tentative. Hours of debate yielded a statement that the European Council “acknowledged the European aspirations and the European choice of Ukraine” and would task officials in Brussels with providing an assessment.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen regularly touts the country’s “European future.” In a visit to Kyiv in April, she handed Zelensky a questionnaire that marks the first stage of the candidacy process and offered words of support. “Dear Volodymyr, my message today is clear: Ukraine belongs in the European family,” she said. “This is where your path toward the European Union begins.”
In Brussels, several E.U. diplomats said von der Leyen had overpromised, either because she misjudged the mood among member states or because she hoped to nudge them forward.
More than one diplomat put the odds of candidate status at “50/50.” A few were more skeptical, predicting a half-step, such as the promise of candidate status at some point in the future, so long as conditions are met.
Stefanishyna, the deputy prime minister, said the starting point for Ukraine was candidate status without conditions. “We are not playing the game of promises,” she said.",leader happy to pose with

35,3148,"Student Loses Scholarship Over Political Correctness Class Requirement
","JANESVILLE, Wisconsin – Chalk up one more victory for liberal fascism. Judy Pierrot was thrilled when Hanswurst University, her ‘first choice school,’ accepted her for the class of 2018. The 18-year-old knew from childhood that her future would somehow involve environmental work, so when she discovered renowned arts and environmental sciences school Hanswurst, everything fell into place.
By high school graduation, Judy had taken so many advanced placement courses that college recruiters were contacting her. Scholarship offers were “almost an embarrassment of riches,” said Judy’s mother Marilyn. “The phone rang constantly.”
“I decided on Hanswurst the minute I got the brochure,” said Judy. “I didn’t bother completing my ‘safety school’ applications. First of all, we couldn’t afford all the application fees but mostly because I knew Hanswurst was the one.”
All went smoothly during the university’s orientation week. Things began to go awry when the new freshman registered for classes. Judy explained, “They asked me about the ‘PC’ class and thought they meant computer class. I said I had a Mac so I didn’t need any PC classes. They thought I was making a joke.”
Hanswurst U requires all first-year students to complete and pass a political correctness course. The university adopted a “zero-tolerance policy” on cultural insensitivity after several students complained of an “oppressively Eurocentric course load, not representative of the global population.” Admissions Director Milton Arbogast explained: “A group of marginalized students threatened legal action. After we met with community groups from the Chicago area, we made Political Correctness 111 part of the core curriculum. It involves role-playing exercises and gives our more privileged students a taste of what our less fortunate students deal with.”
Judy reshuffled her schedule and enrolled in the class.
Upon entering PC 111, Judy was immediately told to stand at the back of the classroom, and instructed not to speak unless spoken to. “I was confused at first,” she said, “but I figured out it was a play-acting exercise, because it was a Liberal Expressions Department course.”
The exercises became more intense as the hour went on. Judy decided to leave when one of the instructors asked her to explain the obvious guilt she felt from being a member of a “dominant culture of privilege.”
“They wanted me to wear a judge’s robe and they started chanting ‘Judge Judy, Judge Judy.’ The whole thing was insulting. I’ve never treated anyone different – so I told the instructor I wasn’t going to attend any more classes and then I left.”
That afternoon, her scholarship was revoked and her admission was invalidated.
Marilyn Pierrot drove to campus the following day to move her daughter back home. “My daughter’s freedom of expression – freedom of everything was denied because some politically damn correction group got bent out of shape about something they never got because they never worked for it. They want everything handed to them!”
When reached for comment, Director Arbogast replied via phone message: “Sadly, this is now a legal matter. The University maintains our commitment to equal and fair treatment for all. The course requirement was clearly outlined in student materials and we regret the unfortunate situation that led to the withdrawal of one of our students who showed great promise.”

36,316,"Global Warmist Bill Gates and His Beach Mansion
","Speaking for the globalist liberal elite, prominent ecowarrior Bill Gates tells us to eat synthetic food because according to their religion, meat causes global warming, which in turn will cause the seas to rise. While promoting for the pointless and unachievable goal of zero emissions, the pursuit of which would radically reduce our standard of living, Gates squeaks,
    As sea levels and floodplains change, we’ll need to rethink where we put homes and businesses.
Yet like other wealthy moonbats who have supported global warming dogma (e.g., Al Gore, Barack Obama, Jeff Bezos), the spot he chooses for his own home is right on the beach:
    [C]onstruction has got underway on a massive oceanfront estate in Southern California believed to be owned by 66-year-old Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, for him to use as his ‘summer bachelor pad’.
    The six-bedroom, three-bathroom 5,800 square-foot home situated in tony Del Mar, north of San Diego, was purchased by the Gates in March 2020 for $43million…
    It was one of the most expensive home purchases ever in San Diego County, but Gates is now carrying out a gut renovation on the house in order to effectively build a brand new property for himself which will ultimately occupy more than 6,000 square feet when complete, across four parcels of land.
Clearly Gates knows as well as we do that the climate crisis is a crock of crap.

37,317,"White House Tells Americans to Endure High Gas Prices to Save “Liberal World Order”
","The White House has told Americans they must continue to endure crippling high gas prices in order to preserve the “liberal world order” and support Ukraine.
Yes, really.
The comments were made by Biden advisor Brian Deese during a CNN interview when he was asked about the cost of living crisis.
“What do you say to those families that say, listen, we can’t afford to pay $4.85 a gallon for months, if not years?” the host asked Deese.
“This is about the future of the Liberal World Order and we have to stand firm,” Deese responded.

Countless Americans couldn’t care less about preserving the “liberal world order” in support of Ukraine, and would undoubtedly rather put America first.
Indeed, polls have shown that whenever they’re told the consequences of ‘supporting Ukraine’, appetite for American involvement plummets.
But that’s not the view of the president, who also said yesterday that Americans should suffer pain at the pump for “as long as it takes” because ‘Putin bad man’.

Biden once again blamed “Russia, Russia, Russia” for high gas prices, despite inflation already soaring before the war in Ukraine and his sanctions exacerbating the crisis.

A Rasmussen poll found that only 11 per cent of Americans believe the Biden administration’s narrative that Vladimir Putin is to blame for record high gas prices
“The Biden regime is crashing the global economy just to stick it to Putin and they don’t give a damn how many Americans and Europeans have to suffer,” comments Chris Menahan.
“You must be made to suffer for as long as it takes to secure the future of the Liberal World Order and ensure every town, city, state and nation throughout the world can host a Gay Pride Parade.”
Biden loyalists have become increasingly absurd in trying to explain away gas price hikes and inflation, with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers blaming people who downplay what happened on January 6.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also ludicrously claimed “nationalism” was to blame for inflation, asserting, “The rise– whether you call it nationalism or the rise of this belief that we have to focus on communities that have been devastated by globalization, we need to find ways of creating better jobs for more Americans, that in itself is inflationary.”
No one with any critical thinking skills is buying it.

38,3149,"Trump Administration to Launch “Black Beans Matter” Campaign
","The Trump Administration has launched a “Black Beans Matter” (“Frijoles Negros Importan”) campaign in support of a Goya Foods whose top executive was criticized last week for supporting President Trump. The campaign is focused on increasing sales of Mexican owned Goya food brands, as well as securing Latino votes for the upcoming election.
Critics of the president have been calling for a boycott of Goya after CEO Robert Unanue stated “We’re all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump, who is a builder” at a White House event. Unanue continued, “”He came to this country to build, to grow, to prosper. And so we have an incredible builder, and we pray for our leadership, our president, and we pray for our country that we will continue to prosper and to grow.””
The president’s daughter, who serves as a formal adviser to the president in the White House, tweeted late Tuesday in both English and Spanish along with a photo of her posing with can of black beans in support of the upcoming campaign.
The president again commented on the controversy Wednesday with the following tweet:
Critics of the president, as well as ethics officials, have criticized the move citing federal ethics law that states, in part, “An employee’s position or title should not be used to coerce; to endorse any product, service or enterprise; or to give the appearance of governmental sanction.” The Trump campaign has notoriously ignored the Hatch Act and this latest incident will likely be no different.
White House communications aide Carolina Hurley defended Ivanka’s tweet by stating: “Only the media and the cancel culture movement would criticize Ivanka for showing her personal support for a company that has been unfairly mocked, boycotted and ridiculed for supporting this administration — one that has consistently fought for and delivered for the Hispanic community,” adding “Ivanka is proud of this strong, Hispanic-owned business with deep roots in the U.S. and has every right to express her personal support.”
The announcement of the Black Beans Matter campaign has led to a fresh round of #BoycottGoya backlash, as well as outrage from supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement. Celebrities from Chrissy Teigen to Lin-Manuel Miranda, as well as politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have joined in the boycott and have used their massive platforms to draw attention to the cause.

39,313,"It’s Questionable Whether Joe Biden Understands American Values 
","Recently Joe Biden warned us that “standing up for our values is not without costs.” But what values is Biden talking about when he says that?
Joe Biden’s terrible and inexcusable missteps caused him to seek ways that take the spotlight off his administration’s many grotesque failures. These failures make America vulnerable to chaos occurring worldwide.
The war between Russia and Ukraine will significantly accelerate more economic pain (inflation, shortages, “supply-chain” disruptions, etc.). Biden would like to “soften us up” for some economic “hard blows” we will endure in the coming days and months. Using manipulation tactics and talking points about “our values,”
Biden hopes to coalesce national pride and a team spirit amid real economic pain and uncertainty. He reminds Americans, “standing up for our values is not without costs.” His statement totally sidesteps questions like, “What are our values?” And “Is Joe Biden helping or hindering standing up for our values?”
People from all over the world still come to America to embrace America’s commitment to “liberty and justice for all.” Viewed through the lens of collective zeal for liberty, however, government-mandated vaccine policies and mandatory masking certainly do not comport with “our values.” Yet, Biden continues these onerous mandates despite growing scientific evidence showing they are far more damaging than helpful.
America’s collective desire for liberty and justice extends to national sovereignty and border policies. But open and marginally secured borders encouraging illegal migration fosters neither liberty nor justice either for Americans or those who are human/sex trafficked. Weak border policies also dramatically accelerate drug and weapon trafficking. Needless to say, these policies don’t comport with “our values” either. So, what exactly does Joe mean by “our values?”
Recent polling confirms Americans believe “our values” include protecting national sovereignty via our borders, something that should come before going around the world to protect other nations’ borders. It’s hard to fathom, but Biden is more zealous about protecting Ukraine’s sovereignty (including sending U.S. border agents to help protect Ukrainian borders), instead of protecting the sovereignty and security of America’s borders. Americans want to see a strong commitment to safeguarding sovereignty and “democracy” at home before becoming the world’s police and champions of “democracy” elsewhere. Get our own house in order first—that reflects the core of “our values!”
We also see energy independence as an essential American value. Biden’s policies significantly limiting oil and gas drilling in America have weakened us and made us unnecessarily vulnerable to America’s foes. Importing energy from nefarious nation-states seeking to undermine America’s liberty—that isn’t one of “our values.” Policies that produce energy independence to meet the demands of a vibrant economy while providing lower fuel costs are “our values!” Biden seems purposely blind to and ignorant about this American value, instead, embracing irrationality and imprudence.
Notably, “our values” also demand safety in civil society. Escalating crimes encouraged by “no bail reforms” and by “defunding” law enforcement agencies create chaotic and unsafe communities. These policies are not “our values!”
Safe streets and communities where children can play without threat are quintessential American traditions and values. Yet, Biden’s “soft on crime” initiatives (bolstered by his political party and supporters) have turned American streets and neighborhoods into wholly unsafe battle zones. With Biden policies demonstrating leniency and partiality toward criminals—ignoring law-abiding citizens’ safety concerns—America doesn’t stand for “liberty and justice for all.”
Ironically, Joe Biden has an excellent opportunity to confirm “our values.” If he’s sincere, he will focus on immediate policies like securing U.S. national sovereignty (via borders). He would do this before securing the borders of aligned partners in foreign lands.
He would also immediately focus on halting the escalating cartel activities that rob us of fundamental decency via human / sex / drug / weapon trafficking. With the “stroke of a pen” Biden would also advance American values by immediately reinitiating all drilling permits so America can once again become energy independent (as we were when he became President). Lastly, he would make sure his supporters and political party renounce and denounce the “no bail” and “defund police” movements. These policy moves would all reflect “our values.”
Americans aren’t stupid. It doesn’t work to use insincere pablum to supposedly “soften the blow” of impending economic chaos and to encourage collective teamwork to get through it when there is no genuine, principled desire to stand for our real values.
We must stand for American values, including sovereign national borders, energy independence,and safe communities. But unfortunately, Biden’s policies reveal these are not his values. His statement made clear that his values will indeed come with a very high “cost.” But Americans collectively paying high (and altogether preventable) costs is not an acceptable answer when the “values” aren’t ours. Biden must abandon his destructive policies and embrace real American values.

40,312,"Belgium Party Leader: 'Islamic Street Thugs Have Taken Over Streets and Neighborhoods'
","In Brussels, native or indigenous Belgians are already in the minority; nearly 80% of the population is of foreign origin.
Last month, a prominent American photographer, Donald Woodrow, was brutally attacked by a Moroccan Islamic minor in Antwerp, Belgium. The attempted murder, caught on video and in broad daylight, left Woodrow with a concussion and dislocated shoulder.
The migrant can be seen approaching Woodrow from behind and viciously punching him in the head, causing him to crumple over. The well-traveled U.S. photographer who works for the National Geographic and other news agencies explains:
    In my career, I have traveled the whole world, and I have never been attacked. Only in Antwerp, where I was previously robbed twice of all my photo equipment
Flemish Member of Parliament for the Vlaams Belang party, Sam van Rooy, believes that Woodrow’s statement and attack are one more example of how “bad” migrant violence is “in the large cities of Western Europe; due to mass migration.”
The leader stated, “our streets, our neighborhoods are taken over by these Moroccan street thugs, and street thugs from North Africa, from an Islamic country.”
Sam van Rooy, also the Party leader of Antwerp City Council, urged the mayor to address the migrant problem by increasing the police presence and number of arrests. Furthermore, the judicial system refuses to impose penalties on migrants for their illegal behavior.
    So I wish Bart de Wever [Mayor of Antwerp] would take care of it, that his police would be put in greater force. An additional problem is that when these young rascals are arrested, which doesn’t happen very often, unfortunately, they are immediately set free. So the leniency is enormous, and naturally, that must also be tackled, by extremely harder, longer prison sentences.
Islamization of Belgium
Vlaams Belang is not wrong to be concerned about the Islamization of Antwerp or Belgium as a whole. The Muslim community continues to grow through both high birth rates and marriage migration. As reported previously at RAIR, one-third of Belgium’s population is of foreign origin. The largest number of those being of Moroccan descent. Ninety-nine percent of Morocco’s population are Muslims. In Brussels, native or indigenous Belgians are already in the minority; nearly 80% of the population is of foreign origin.
According to Statbel, the country’s statistical office, in 2020, the most popular names for male babies in over a dozen municipalities throughout Brussels are Islamic, specifically Mohamed, Mohammed, and Ahmed (another form of Mohammad). 
European Union elites are using migrants to replace European populations. Furthermore, they are being used by the left to dilute host cultures, ensure more votes, and seize power.
ISLAM Party
Islamic supremacists have capitalized on the growing number of Muslims in Belgium. One example was the formation of a political party to push for the total replacement of Western law with sharia. Belgium’s ISLAM Party leaders openly admitted they wanted to turn the country into an Islamic State. However, they called it an “Islamist democracy” and set a target date for 2030.
“Our goal is a 100% Islamic State” stated the party’s founder Redouane Ahrouch. “By establishing Sharia law, we want to follow the way of the prophet and the Quran,” he adds. ISLAM’s Party leader openly expressed his desire to adopt sharia in Belgium, legalize polygamy, ban alcohol, and separate men and women.
The ISLAM Party can freely state their dangerous plans to Islamize Belgium, but protesting this threatening declaration is considered “hateful and violent” and can now land you in prison.
MEP Silvia Sardone: “Brussels Is Going To Become An Islamic Capital”
Instead of Belgium’s left-wing leaders closing the borders and reversing the flow of migration, they have gone to great lengths to hide or ignore the crisis and prosecute those who speak out about its real consequences for the safety of Belgians. 
Four members of the Voorpost party were arrested for their non-violent speech and sentenced to six months in prison. The men unfurled a banner with women wearing niqabs and burqas and the words: ‘Stop Islamization”. A Belgium court found the men guilty of “inciting hatred and violence against the Muslim population.” 
Silvia Sardone, an Italian MEP for Matteo Salvini’s Lega Party, slammed Belgium’s conviction of the four members of Voorpost. The MEP shined a spotlight on the Islamization of Belgium and its take over of government and society. The leader stated, “At this rate, Brussels will become an Islamic capital in twenty years.”
Never before has a prosecutor prosecuted protesters who held a peaceful protest based on a banner. The trial was a test case for freedom of expression, which has been proven to be non-existent in Islamized Belgium. Moreover, the ruling showed that while Judaism and Christianity can be disparaged with impunity, warning about the Islamization and spread of Sharia will lead to swift and hefty legal penalties, including incarceration.",belgium party leader islamic street thug have take over street and neighborhood,"[(belgium, 'NNP'), (party, 'NNP'), (leader, 'NN'), (islamic, 'NNP'), (street, 'NNP'), (thug,

41,311,"Journalist names obstacle to peace between Ukraine and Russia
","The Ukrainian leader is “dangerous” as he’s ready to sacrifice his people to stay in power, Angelo D’Orsi claims 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is the main obstacle to peace between his country and Russia, renowned Italian journalist and historian Angelo D'Orsi has told RT.
D’Orsi has been left disappointed by the coverage of the Ukrainian conflict in the Western media, including in his home country of Italy.
In March, he refused to continue cooperating with major newspaper La Stampa after it used a photo of the aftermath of a missile attack on Donetsk by the Kiev forces to illustrate a headlining article bout about Russian strikes in western Ukraine. The paper has reached “the bottom of journalistic dishonesty” with this move, D’Orsi insisted in one of the interviews.
The veteran journalist rejects attempts to portray Zelensky as a hero, warning that the Ukrainian leader is actually “a very dangerous character.”
“In my opinion, Zelensky now represents the biggest obstacle to achieving peace because it seems obvious to me that he’s is ready to sacrifice his country and his people in order to stay in power,” D’Orsi said.
The Ukrainian president is “absolutely preventing any diplomatic solution, any peace talks. And he’s proven it many times,” he added.
Russian and Ukrainian delegations of various levels have held several rounds of peace negotiations since the outbreak of the fighting. But there have been no face-to-face meetings since late March, when the sides met in Istanbul, Turkey, although Russia says the talks continue every day via videolink. Moscow was initially optimistic about the outcome of the Istanbul talks, but later blamed Kiev for backtracking on the agreements that had been reached there. On Wednesday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Moscow has lost all trust in Ukrainian negotiators, adding that it was the reason why the differences between the neighbors kept being settled on the ground.
On April 16, Zelensky issued an ultimatum to Russia: the President of Ukraine said that if Russian troops destroyed the Ukrainian military remaining in Mariupol, then there would be no negotiations. On April 21, Russia decided against storming the town’s Azovstal steel plant, where the Ukrainian troops are besieged. Moscow declared Mariupol ‘liberated.’ On the same day, Zelensky said he does not rule out that the de-blockading of Mariupol could happen by military means.
Zelensky “acts as if this confrontation was a personal conflict between [Russia’s President Vladimir] Putin and him” without actually caring about Ukraine, D’Orsi insisted.
The comedian-turned-president “seems totally clueless to me, not fit to cope with such a situation,” he added.
Zelensky’s “frantic activeness,” which includes filming numerous videos and delivering video addresses with demands for help before lawmakers in the US, EU and elsewhere, “could eventually backfire against him,” the journalist warned.
The Ukrainian leader has been asking the West for weapons deliveries, financial and humanitarian aid, increased sanctions pressure on Russia, and EU membership for his country. However, many of his requests remain unfulfilled, including a demand to close Ukraine’s skies to Russian planes, which is almost certain to provoke a conflict between Moscow and NATO.
D’Orsi also insisted that use of the word “genocide” by Zelensky to describe the events in Ukraine was “unacceptable.”
He is Jewish, but the Ukrainian leader “shouldn’t forget that neo-Nazis are now supporting his government,” he said.
“It’s really a paradox when one speaks about genocide to justify one’s own policies, forgetting that he’s backed by the descendants of the very people who persecuted the Jews in the 1930s and 1940s,” the journalist pointed out.
Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.
The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.

42,3128,"USDA Now Asking People to Register Their Vegetable Gardens for National Database
","Why in the world does the United States Department of Agriculture need to know if you have a vegetable garden and furthermore, why would they need that information in a national database? If you understand unlawful executive orders, you’ll know why, but to that in a moment.
Begin by watching the USDA’s taxpayer funded propaganda and pushed on criminal accomplices to the agenda in social media.

The video above is petitioning people to register their local gardens. Don’t do it! It’s none of the fed’s business if you have a garden or not!
By the way, if you were interested in registering a garden, it’s pretty easy to meet their standards.
School gardens, community gardens, urban farms, and small-scale agriculture projects in rural, suburban and urban areas can be recognized as a “People’s Garden” if they register on the USDA website and meet criteria including benefitting the community, working collaboratively, incorporating conservation practices and educating the public.
So, while much of this is true, it should be noted that it has zero to do with the federal government and would be best dealt with by individuals in their own community. In fact, not only is there a push for individuals to garden now, more than ever, but there is talk of building community through things like grand jury, militia and community gardens.
The USDA has this to say about naming the People’s Garden:
The People’s Garden was named in honor of USDA’s founder, President Abraham Lincoln, who described USDA as “The People’s Department.” The first People’s Garden at USDA headquarters was started by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on February 12, 2009 – Lincoln’s 200th birthday.
“…the most valuable of all arts will be the art of deriving a comfortable subsistence from the smallest area of soil.” – Abraham Lincoln
Well, why not pick the most tyrannical president in US history to advance a socialist agenda? Seems appropriate.
The USDA then goes on to invite you into their spider’s web.
See what’s happening at the USDA’s National Headquarters Garden in Washington, D.C.
Visit our 17 urban hubs and hundreds of locations across the nation and beyond.
People’s Gardens grow fresh, healthy food and support a resilient, local food system; teach people how to garden using sustainable practices; and nurture habitat for pollinators and wildlife, and greenspace for neighbors to gather and enjoy. People’s Gardens all:
- Benefit the community by providing food, beautification, arts, wildlife habitat, education, green space, tree canopy, recreation, volunteer opportunities.
- Are a collaborative effort involving neighbors, co-workers, food pantries, master gardeners, conservation districts, USDA agencies, veterans, youth organizations, seniors, faith-based groups, or others.
- Incorporate sustainable practices such as rain barrels or micro-irrigation, composting, cover crops, pest management, bat houses or insect hotels, and/or native plants.
- Educate the public about sustainable practices and the benefit of local food systems through signage, classes, events, outreach materials, websites, and youth field trips.

“We welcome gardens nationwide to join us in the People’s Garden effort and all it represents,” said Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, “Local gardens across the country share USDA’s goals of building more diversified and resilient local food systems, empowering communities to come together around expanding access to healthy food, addressing climate change and advancing equity.”
Secretary Vilsack added: “We encourage existing gardens and new gardens to join the movement. Growing local food benefits local communities in so many ways, and we offer technical resources to help. Also, it’s a great way to connect with your local USDA team members.”
Matt Agorist comments on this pointing out that the USDA, nor the federal government for that matter, has been authorized to do any of this, let alone keeping Americans healthy. In fact, the USDA does quite the opposite, allowing genetically modified organisms, hormones pumped into animals and terrible upkeep of many animals that will be sold to consumers for food.
Agorist writes:
Again, it is important to point out that the mission statement of the USDA does not involve anything to do with keeping Americans healthy. In fact, their track record over the years has done the complete opposite.
Case in point: In December 2020, a scientific committee, composed of 20 academics and doctors, recommended cutting the limit for added sugars in the diet to 6% of daily calories from 10% in the current guidelines. The group compiled a massive trove of data and presented this request to the USDA citing rising rates of obesity and the link between obesity and health problems like Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.
To be clear, you need absolutely 0% of your diet to be comprised of sugar but this panel seemingly knew the USDA — who hands out billions of taxpayer dollars to companies who specialize in addicting Americans to sugar — would never get behind a recommendation against all sugar. So, they offered a slight concession.
This scientific committee asked for a measly 4% drop in the USDA’s recommended sugar intake in foods — providing 835 pages of evidence showing the horrifying effects it is having on children and adults — and the USDA refused.
“The new evidence is not substantial enough to support changes to quantitative recommendations for either added sugars or alcohol,” Brandon Lipps, deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at the USDA told the Wall Street Journal at the time.
In December of 2020, it was clear that excessive sugar intake was connected to comorbidities like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity — all of which drastically increased complications from a COVID-19 infection. Yet the USDA — who pretends to care about your health — refused to budge in the slightest.
Now, this same organization is claiming that it wants you to register your vegetable garden so it can place you in a database and put your healthy food source on a map — for your health, of course. You also get a cool sign for your front yard too.
While a handful of folks inside the USDA may have well-meaning intentions behind this program, the behemoth organization’s track record and history clearly indicate that the overwhelming majority of them do not care about your health. Not only do they not care about your health but most of their farm and food budget goes toward subsidizing products that directly harm your health.
So, skepticism over a national garden database run by this organization is entirely warranted. As the world teeters on the verge of nuclear war and economic collapse, remember that in times of war and economic downturns, food is more valuable than gold.

43,3114,"This 1 sentence explains what’s wrong with the Web!
","The trouble with Web journalism, in a single sentence: Dylan Byers of Politico explains the “real problem” with Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight web site–it’s not “relevant” to the “news of the day.” Byers’ big example:
‘”To wit; Two days after FiveThirtyEight relaunched, Janet Yellen held her first Federal Open Market Committee meeting, resulting in the broadest sell-off in stocks since the Eurozone crisis. Here was a story that lent itself to the empirical, data-driven analysis Silver champions. Silver could have owned this story throughout the day. For instance, he could have done a data-rich analysis about the interplay between the Fed and financial markets. But the only Yellen-related thing FiveThirtyEight produced that day was a pre-meeting curtain-raiser ….”
In short, according to Byers, FiveThirtyEight needs an editor who says
“If the news of the day is Yellen, what can we do on Yellen?” [E.A.]
Wow. It’s come to that. More Yellen! In one of the great technological leaps of humankind, we escaped the tyranny of MSM gatekeepers only to replace it with the tyranny of the “news of the day.” I thought with 24/7 coverage we’d gotten rid of days! And who decides what’s the “news of the day”? Mike Allen? Your stats program?
What about the idea that with a good enough story or piece of writing on an “off” topic you can make something that isn’t the news of the day the news of the day? Or the day after tomorrow, anyway.
P.S.: To wit: What about Byers’ big example? Do you care today about the FOMC meeting that Byers says Silver should have devoted his website to? Is it a satisfying experience for readers to be bombarded, everywhere they turn, with masturbatory riffs on the same two or three quickly dated stories, only to have them replaced by other masturbatory riffs tomorrow? …
P.P.S.: Meanwhile, here are the FiveThirtyEight stories Byers scorns (“Relevant to the news cycle? Not really”):
“‘Can Evolution Outrace Climate Change?”;The next item is ‘The Imperfect Pursuit of a Perfect Baseball Forecast..’ Then there’s ‘Residents of Struggling Cities Opt to Skip Town.””
Maybe it’s just me, but those seem kind of intriguing.
It would be one thing if Byers said that Silver was unlikely to make money with his off-news approach. But the critique is presented with an unknowing self-righteousness, as if Silver is screwing up–he just doesn’t know the business. It’s an attitude I last encountered when a leaflet I distributed failed to conform to some meaningless election law requirement** that anyone who was a pro would know about. ….
P.P.P.S.: I usually enjoy Byers!

","Maybe the establishment doesn’t know it due to their narcissism and the symbiotic CDC-FDA-Pfizer cash cow they are shooting into their veins, but no matter how many bots try to prop it up on Twitter, the world isn’t buying the vaccine lockdown Great Reset prison planet lie anymore.
The Johns Hopkins Pandemic study showed that the lockdowns did more harm than good.
Hundreds of people under 40 are going into cardiac arrest and suffering from Sudden Adult death syndrome.
Celebrities are dying, countless vaccine injuries and deaths are all over twitter and blood clot gaslighting is coming out of the woodwork.
Stillbirth numbers are skyrocketing and male fertility is plummeting while the ineffective vaccines themselves can’t compete with Natural immunity.
And recently, a Swedish study revealed what had been relegated to conspiracy theory to be horribly true.
The masks not only never worked, but research is now showing they may actually make you sick.
The rationale behind their widespread mandated usage must be questioned.
Using CDC data, researchers with the University of Louisville calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the U.S.
No significant differences were found in case growth between mandate and non-mandate states during periods of low or high transmission.
“The widespread use of masks did not reduce COVID-19 transmission in Europe, and a moderate positive correlation was found between mask usage and deaths in Western Europe. An update to a CDC study on school mask mandates, using nearly six times more data, found no significant relationship between mask mandates in U.S. schools and COVID-19 case rates. In Kansas, counties with a mask mandate had significantly higher COVID-19 case fatality rates than counties without a mask mandate. One way masks cause harm may be the ‘Foegen effect’ — the idea that deep re-inhalation of droplets and virions caught on facemasks might make COVID-19 infection more likely or more severe. In fact Dr. Shanna Swan, a professor of Environmental Medicine & Public Health at Mount Sinai Health System, has warned in a new book that phthalates, a chemical commonly used in the manufacturing of plastics, can shrink penises and decrease male fertility.”
Fauci and company need to prepare for the inevitable repercussions they cannot escape.
Everyone knows or will soon know that the entire pandemic response has been a blatant ruse that created 500 new billionaires, crippled our economy, exponentially killed and injured millions and decimated our educational system.

45,3129,"Québec Solidaire courts big business ahead of provincial election
","Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, Québec Solidaire’s (QS) principal spokesperson and candidate for premier, was invited to speak before the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal (CCMM), the city’s most prominent big business lobby group, four days before Quebec’s October 3 provincial election.
The former student leader seized on the opportunity to tone down, to the point of virtually discarding, Québec Solidaire’s image as a “left-wing” party.
Quebec Solidaire’s posture as a “protest” party—a “party of the street and the ballot box”—helped it gain a popular following, especially among young people, and to advance its efforts to resurrect the discredited and politically retrograde Quebec indépendantiste (separatist) program. But the pseudo-left party’s leadership now sees its image as a party of “protest” as detrimental to its aspirations to play an even more important role in establishment politics.
Nadeau-Dubois took advantage of his appearance before the CCMM to reassure his audience that QS is a “responsible” party, fully committed to defending profits—one that be trusted with the role of official opposition in Quebec’s next parliament. Currently polls show QS, which won 10 seats in the 125-member National Assembly in 2018, virtually tied with the Liberals for second place in voter support.
According to press reports, the QS leader told the CCMM that “the real economic issue” is “the risks of not acting quickly enough—the risks of climate passivity.”
Behind its “pro-environment” rhetoric, Québec Solidaire’s central objective is to make the province a “world leader” in the lucrative field of “green energy.” Its website states that it is committed to “making strategic investments in two key sectors of the ecological transition: residual forest biomass and the battery industry.”
In a tweet published after his September 29 speech to a blue-chip audience of Montreal-area corporate executives and business lobbyists, Nadeau-Dubois said, “Thank you to the @chambremontreal for the invitation and the opportunity to discuss our economic vision.” He explained that “the heart of our campaign is the fight against climate change: We must invest to accelerate the ecological transition.”
With its “climate-friendly” rhetoric, QS seeks to mask the material interests of the Quebec business elite, whose interests it proposes to advance by providing strong state support for growth in the global renewable energy sector. Its argument is that Quebec is well-positioned to succeed in this promising market thanks to its natural resources, its lithium reserves (an essential component of the modern electric battery), its vast river system and its expertise in hydroelectricity. Disguised by QS as a concern for the environment, its “green” capitalist program overlaps in many ways with that of both the Parti Québécois (PQ), a fellow Quebec sovereignist party, and the Liberals.
QS’s program for making Quebec a “clean energy” power was well received by the CCMM. After making polite criticisms of the derisory tax increases proposed by QS (such as a 0.1 percent annual wealth tax increase on assets over $1 million), CCMM President Michel Leblanc welcomed QS’s proposals. “Your message,” he told Nadeau-Dubois, “in terms of challenges and probably solutions speaks to the business community.”
Le Devoir, a daily newspaper with close ties to Quebec nationalist circles, ran an article on the QS leader’s speech to the CCMM under the approving headline “Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois: from the streets to the Chamber of Commerce’s top table.”
Even more tellingly, QS was applauded last week by none other than Mario Dumont. Now a leading columnist for the Journal de Montréal—the right-wing populist daily of wealthy businessman and erstwhile PQ leader Pierre Karl Péladeau—Dumont played a leading role, as head of the Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ), in a virulent agitation against religious minorities in 2006-2007. In his column, Dumont congratulated the QS leadership for its “seriousness” and its ability to keep its “extreme left” on a leash.
Those now heaping praise on QS are representatives of a Quebec ruling class that has spent the last four decades making massive cuts to education and health care; cutting taxes for the rich while telling the working class that there is “no money” for wages and pensions; fanning anti-immigrant chauvinism; and supporting the Canadian government’s turn to militarism.
Far from dissociating itself from its new admirers in the ruling elite, QS is actively seeking their blessing. This fact underscores that QS is a party of the affluent middle class. It is largely composed of university professors, small business owners, doctors, lawyers and managers, etc.
These social layers enjoy a comfortable existence within a capitalist system that subjects masses of workers to the scourges of unemployment, precarious work and poverty on a daily basis. This is why the most vital issues for the international working class—the US-NATO war against Russia over Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, the danger of fascism and the re-emergence of mass social struggles—have been totally excluded from QS’s election campaign.
A self-proclaimed pro-independence, environmentalist, feminist, anti-globalization “citizen’s party,” QS says next to nothing about the struggles of the working class and is utterly hostile to mobilizing this social force against bankrupt capitalism. One would search in vain for any serious comment or even references by its candidates to the many bitter contract struggles that have recently erupted in Quebec, whether in the public sector, the agri-food industry, construction, the ports of Montreal and Quebec City or the manufacturing sector—let alone workers’ struggles around the world.
The orientation of QS is to the pro-capitalist union bureaucracy, which has been suppressing rank-and-file resistance for decades, and has developed a vast network of lucrative corporatist partnerships with big business and the capitalist state. But apart from a few isolated cases, the union apparatus has rebuffed Québec Solidaire’s advances. The unions have instead either maintained their historically close ties with the PQ or moved closer to the right-wing CAQ (Coalition avenir Québec), which has been in power for the past four years.
On international developments, now dominated by bitter geopolitical conflicts and the mounting threat of nuclear war, QS has little to say, despite its advocacy of Quebec independence. It has never criticized, let alone led any campaign against, the sharp increases in Canadian military spending, or the federal government’s procuring of new fleets of warplanes and warships. It has fully supported Ottawa's participation in US-led imperialist wars and interventions for control of raw materials and geostrategic regions, whether in Afghanistan, Haiti, Libya, Iraq or Syria.
QS supports the US-led war against Russia in Ukraine, in which Canadian imperialism plays an important role. At the beginning of the conflict, it tabled a motion—unanimously adopted by the other capitalist parties—that camouflaged the aggressive and provocative role of the US and NATO, placed all the blame on Russia and repeated the lie that the war was about defending the “right of the Ukrainian people to live in a peaceful, prosperous and sovereign country.”
Throughout the pandemic, which is far from over, QS has supported the Legault government in its homicidal “live with the virus” policy. Its co-spokesperson Manon Massé even participated with other opposition party leaders in months of closed-door discussions with Legault during the pandemic’s first year. The ties between QS and the government were so close that rank-and-file members raised concerns that the party was being brought into disrepute. The result of the pandemic policy supported by QS is that more than 16,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the province, and hundreds of thousands are likely to be affected by the potentially debilitating impacts of Long COVID.
QS has also played a key role in legitimizing the chauvinist turn the Quebec ruling class has taken for over a decade, with the aim of dividing workers along ethnic lines and scapegoating immigrants for the social crisis caused by capitalism. This found expression under the Legault government in a series of anti-democratic laws targeting immigrants and minorities. QS voted in favour of Bill 96, which reinforces the privileged status of the French language. It is formally opposed to Bill 21, which discriminates against religious minorities—with Muslim women a special target—but announced that it would not make an issue of it in the election campaign.
On the economic front, QS has boasted that it has put forward “credible” budget proposals, including a timetable for balancing the provincial budget that is more ambitious than that set by the CAQ and the Liberals.
While QS is forced to acknowledge the socio-economic crisis affecting the vast majority of the population—deepening economic insecurity and social inequality, rampant inflation, an acute housing crisis, etc.—it has nothing serious to offer, as it accepts the capitalist framework that are their cause.
All that is left of its previous, already timid, “reform” agenda are half-measures. The party has abandoned more substantive proposals, such as free public education at all levels, which was the central demand of the massive 2012 Quebec student strike that propelled Nadeau-Dubois to the political forefront.
QS’s meagre election promises will quickly be cast aside, as evidenced by the record of Québec Solidaire’s “sister” parties—Syriza in Greece, the Left Party in Germany or Podemos in Spain—which have ruthlessly imposed the brutal austerity measures demanded by the ruling elite once they entered government.
Workers and young people looking for a real alternative to the historic crisis of capitalism must turn to the Socialist Equality Party and firmly reject QS.
Its initial orientation to the chauvinist PQ, its promotion of Quebec independence so as to establish a third imperialist state in North America, its social composition based on the affluent middle class, its opposition to the class struggle, its quest for “respectability” within the establishment—all of this, under conditions of global capitalist crisis, has definitively exposed Québec Solidaire as a right-wing nationalist party utterly hostile to the working class.

46,3117,"LAB ORIGIN THEORY CONFIRMED: Trump adviser Deborah Birx says COVID “came out of the box ready to infect” after being released from Chinese lab
","When it first arrived, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) “was already more infectious than flu,” according to former Trump adviser Deborah Birx.
A friend of Tony Fauci, Birx says COVID could only be one of two things: an “abnormal thing of nature” or an engineered disease that was cooked up in a lab while researchers were simultaneously “working on coronavirus vaccines” and “accidentally” became “infected.”
Birx claims that communist China is responsible for initially covering up how infectious covid really was – she still apparently believes that the only way to know who really has covid, since it is not always obvious, is to “test” people for it using fraudulent PCR testing schemes.
“China was implying that they were containing it, but asymptomatic spread cannot be contained without testing,” Birx contends.
According to Birx, covid “came out of the box ready to infect” when it first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan back in December 2020. Normally it would take years for a disease like to become infectious, she insists, but this one was immediately ready to go.
“It happens,” Birx says. “Labs aren’t perfect, people aren’t perfect, we make mistakes and there can be contamination.”
In other words, it was all just an “accident,” according to Birx – nothing was intentional. And the plandemic tyranny that resulted was all just a normal response that was not planned in advance at globalist gatherings such as Event 201.
Birx is trying to cover for herself, Fauci, and other plandemic co-conspirators
Keep in mind that Birx and her kind initially denied the idea that covid could have come from a lab, insisting that it magically appeared in bat soup at a wet market in Wuhan.
After that narrative failed, these same folks suddenly agreed that covid could be lab-made, but that it was all just a big accident, which is the narrative that Birx is now running with.
“Someone working in the lab with one of the strains could’ve caught it and not known they had it,” Birx claims.
“In laboratories you grow the virus in human cells, allowing it to adapt more. Each time it passes through human cells, it becomes more adapted.”
Nothing that she, Fauci, or anyone else in the United States did in the aftermath of covid’s appearance was in any way wrong, Birx further contends. In her mind, China is totally to blame because they should have been testing for COVID from the beginning.
“I think the world lost several months of preparation because we were thinking there wasn’t that level of human-to-human spread when there clearly was,” Birx alleges.
China has repeatedly denied that covid leaked from a lab, calling the idea a “conspiracy theory.” And, of course, the communist regime denies any wrongdoing in how it handled the outbreak.
Early on, then-President Donald Trump suggested that covid was probably manufactured in a lab. He was mocked for saying this by the likes of Birx and others.
Since that time, Trump’s ideas have become more and more accepted, especially as it becomes increasingly clear that the entire plandemic was planned by globalists both in the U.S. and elsewhere – and Birx is one such globalist.
It turns out that Birx’s sudden appearance on the world stage is all about grifting her new memoir, which very few people will ever read. She is clearly trying to profit even more from the authoritarian monstrosity that she helped foist on the public in the name of “public health” – but will it work?",lab origin theory confirm trump

","Former White House COVID response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx told FNC Your World host Neil Cavuto that she was urging the vulnerable amid the current COVID-19 wave to take Paxlovid, an anti-viral medication as a means to protect against the virus.
However, she also acknowledged the vaccines were not as effective as many were led to believe and admitted health officials overplayed it. 
""Well, if you're across the South, and you're in the middle of this wave, what's going to save you right now is Paxlovid,"" he said. ""But once we get through this wave, during that lull, you should get vaccinated and boosted because we do believe it will protect you, particularly if you're over 70. I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection. And I think we overplayed the vaccines. And it made people then worry that it's not going to protect against severe disease and hospitalization. It will, but let's be very clear — 50% of the people who died from the Omicron surge were older, vaccinated.""
""So, that's why I'm saying, even if you're vaccinated and boosted if you're unvaccinated, right now, the key is testing and Paxlovid,"" Birx continued. ""It's effective. It's a great antiviral. And, really, that is what's going to save your lives right now if you're over 70, which, if you look at the hospitalizations, hospitalizations are rising steadily, with new admissions, particularly in those over 70. And so, if you live in the South — I know people keep talking about the fall. I'm worried about the South.

48,3112,"Ukraine - Global Hotbed for Mercenaries and Terrorists 
","Western mercenaries are often considered the mainstay of all foreign personnel fighting for the Kiev regime. However, although they’re the ones with the most media exposure, the truth is, there are mercenaries from all around the world fighting for the regime. And although international law outlaws mercenaries, the ones fighting in Ukraine aren’t just “regular soldiers of fortune”, but also international terrorists previously operating in the Middle East and Africa. Even before Russia intervened, information on Islamic terrorists fighting for the Kiev regime was already common knowledge.
Already in late February, Syrian intelligence services intercepted information that the Turks were recruiting troops among the terrorist formations under their control to go fight in Ukraine. According to the information made public at the time, Turks formed and armed at least seven groups of about 100 terrorists in each, which included members of terrorist groups such as Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Harakat Ahrar al-Sham al-Islamiyya and the Islamic Party of Turkestan.
A few weeks later, Iraqi Shia group “Ashab al-Kahf” reported that “military advisors” from the countries of the “anti-ISIS” coalition, namely Lithuania, Italy, Germany and the UK, arrived in Iraq to recruit mercenaries for the Kiev regime forces. Two US bases, Ain el-Assad (Iraq) and Al-Tanf (Syria), were used as headquarters for this operation. Residents from Syria, Iraq, Libya, Turkey, Tunisia, Sudan, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, etc. were given a chance to fight “for democracy”, with priority given to specialists in large-scale urban combat.
On March 8, the Syrian Ambassador to Russia Riyad Haddad announced the threat of “flooding Ukraine with mercenaries and turning it into a big European Idlib.” In early July, he announced the transfer of ISIS terrorists from Idlib to Ukraine, an operation carried out jointly by Turkey, the US and its client states. Earlier, in May, Sergey Ivanov, head of the Press Bureau of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, spoke about the transfer of ISIS soldiers to Ukraine by the Americans. In mid-April, Spokesman of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Igor Konashenkov, stated that at that time and since the beginning of Russia’s intervention, at least 200 Turkish-backed terrorists had arrived in Ukraine. This issue further ruined the already murky reputation of the Kiev regime, as its units were now composed of both Neo-Nazi and Islamic terrorist troops.
It’s pretty clear why the Kiev regime is trying to recruit anyone at this point. Simply put, the motivation of regular Ukrainians to fight for the regime is dwindling, as their forces are suffering heavy casualties, reaching the scale of 10:1, and not in their favor. This is almost perfectly consistent with the scale of artillery supremacy of the Russian forces, which is also 10:1. Just how desperate the Kiev regime is to recruit troops for the “Donbass meat grinder” can be seen in the fact that Ukrainian men are now openly being abducted and pushed to the frontlines. Recently, in Transcarpathia, Ukraine’s westernmost region, police were seen going to recreation centers, including public pools, trying to drag men out of the water and send them to military units.
And this doesn’t only apply to Ukrainian citizens, but also to foreigners residing in Ukraine, including college students. At the start of Russia’s special military operation, when foreigners were being evacuated, including African ex-pat students, some were denied access to trains and buses, while others were told they would be conscripted to the Kiev regime forces. An ABC News journalist interviewed a Congolese national who managed to escape this fate and who said: “We were told: ‘We will give you weapons, and you will fight for Ukraine!’ I say: ‘Eh? Will we fight for Ukraine? We are not Ukrainians. We are black. How can we fight for Ukraine?!’”
On the other hand, there were also mercenaries from some African countries, such as Nigeria, who stated they wanted to fight for the Kiev regime. The regime promised to pay for “their services” and additional funds were sent to the Ukrainian embassy in Nigeria. However, in addition to evidence of military experience, Ukrainian diplomats demanded mercenaries pay $1000 for a visa and a flight ticket, promising a monthly salary of $3,300 dollars, although they previously promised twice as much. At the same time, this is also considered a way for many to use the conflict as an excuse to reach Europe.
What is certainly clear from all this chaos is that the political West seeks to dispose of terrorists and also use them against Russian forces in this war to the last Ukrainian. In addition, Washington DC and London are profiting from all this in the long-term, as mainland Europe is bearing the brunt of the costs and consequences of their proxy war against Russia. Many of the mercenaries and terrorists fighting for the Kiev regime will certainly end up being Europe’s problem, provided they survive the conflict. As already noted, the Kiev regime, for its part, will accept anyone willing to fight in its suicidal confrontation with Russia.

49,3113,"The Great Awakening Continues – 'Ve Vil Not Eet Ze Bugz, Klaus'
","""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist.”— THE USUAL SUSPECTS
When the Canadian truckers descended in peace on Ottawa protesting the vaccine mandate of Justin TrueDOH! it was obvious to many that something fundamental had changed. This wasn’t some Davos Crowd psy-op like burning down Minneapolis or a Million Vagina March.
This was a real awakening of the opposition to the Great Reset. Destroying the livelihoods of the people who bring the goods to our stores was a step too far. Even the most normalcy-biased shitlib had to do a double take at what was happening with the COVID vaccines.
How did we get here so fast?
Davos’ agenda has accelerated in recent months as major events force their hand. From Jerome Powell’s war on the offshore dollar markets to Putin choosing the whether he hangs or we drown, the pillars of their powerbase are crumbling under the weight of their ambitions.
Most people can’t conceive of what these big shifts actually mean. Sadly, they still rely on what small amount of information they get from their overlords to form their opinions. But that information has become so ludicrous, so low quality, it’s got enough people open to questions they would have never contemplated previously.
It’s a start. And once the last vestiges of trust in our media melts away, we’ll see a whole lot more than the protests we’ve seen to date.
Yes, things can get worse.
That said, the catalyst for Europe’s farmers rising up was the crazy miscalculation of Davos‘ minions TrueDOH! and his Ukrainian diaspora bagwoman Chrystia Freeland. Freezing the accounts of truckers and trampling peaceful protestors with horses woke way too many people up.
When you anger the banks, radicalize normies, and create a nationwide bank run you set a countdown timer on your rule.
First they came for the truckers to engineer a supply crisis. People supported them in droves and were trampled.
Now they came for the Dutch farmland to further engineer a food crisis and the farmers took up the Truckers’ flag.
The Dutch farmers that are fighting against the government didn’t erect a flag of the Netherlands in their square but a Canadian Flag. 🇨🇦
An unstoppable movement was started in Canada. pic.twitter.com/hUFpBAQ92T
For weeks I’ve wondered whether the spate of fires at food processing facilities all across North America were sabotage or just the natural downstream effect of overworked people and under-maintained equipment.
It’s a fair point to consider rather then just go off half-cocked about evils of Davos. Because in the end, it doesn’t matter what the truth is (likely a mixture of both), these breakdowns are all their fault anyway.
Thank that idiotic COVID policy.
But how about fertilizer train derailments?
Or a thousand dead cows from heat prostration?
When the Farmers Revolution began in the Netherlands I realized this was something deeper. And I was glad for it. The Great Awakening that began in Ottawa and spread worldwide then has metastasized into a real political nightmare for Klaus Schwab and his merry gang of nihilist midwits.
You know they are on auto-pilot seizing the land of efficient Dutch farmers. The Netherlands is routinely praised by Davos as a kind of sustainable agriculture Mecca. So why go after them? Why not further demonize American farmers. I mean everyone just knows Americans are wasteful and dirty pigs, right?
And then I came across the plans for Tristate City and, for me, it all clicked into place.
Bankrupt the farmers through legislative fiat and seize their land to build the Davos Smart City of the Future. The perfect “Capitol of the Corporatocracy.”
Try googling anything about this connection and you’ll find very little. Look at a Twitter search of “Tristate City” and come to your own conclusions.
Think Minority Report but with Germans.
Periodic Revolution
Davos’ War Against the Periodic Table continues unabated. But notice how they aren’t going after truly poisonous elements like Mercury (Hg) or Thallium (Tl) or even Arsenic (As). FYI, due to their extreme chemistry they are actually easy and cheap to deal with.
No they are going after the building blocks of life itself — Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Sulfur (S), or CHNOPS.
We have the stated goal of ‘decarbonization’ worldwide.
Phosphorus and Nitrogen have been attacked relentlessly as outgrowths of the war on ‘chemical fertilizers,’ smokestack emissions, etc. for decades now.
Our entire transport industry has been made less efficient, raising the costs through unnecessary low-sulfur diesel and bunker fuel rules.
Now we’re supposed to cheer LNG-powered small dry weight tonnage ships as PROGRESS! Yeah, a $350 million boat for moving goods from Jacksonville to Puerto Rico. Brilliant!
Let’s use the most expensive fuel imaginable (liquefied methane) for shipping, an industry where fuel costs are literally everything.
But I thought fracking BAD!
All under the rubric of clean air and buzzwords like ‘sustainability.’
Now I’m all for a clean environment and dealing with real pollution which hampers human life and even the greater ecosystem/food web, but cows producing nitrogen are a part of the natural cycle of this essential element.
What’s next? Legislating away volcanoes?
Anti-Transhumanism
It’s all downstream of convincing so many people to view themselves as a pollutant and to separate human activity out as ‘not-natural.’ Think of the argument framing here and it’s very simple. Humanity is not a part of the ‘natural world.’ Our activities are not an outgrowth of ‘nature’s pure design.’
This is literally the argument about man-made Climate Change. Too bad they had to define man’s energy inputs to the environment in the most idiotic (and inaccurate) way imaginable, by ignoring more than 90% of the energy the sun and the Universe imparts to our planet.
Now add in the basic understanding that everyone has a religion, even atheists. They just turn to worshipping something else. They go from gathering in churches to courthouses, cathedrals to classrooms, and temples to tract housing.
The bottom line folks is this, “Everyone believes in something, even nihilists.”
But this anti-humanism is far worse than any ‘Original Sin’ doctrine of Christianity. There the message is that we are flawed but redeemable because we carry the spark of the divine within us. The path to enlightenment is self-discovery and self-improvement.
There the existential threat is your own legacy, nothing more. It’s an inward journey.
Now the Climate religion has merged cynically with the hubris and colonialism of Davos to create something horrific and deadly. And since they have control over the sacred texts now, they are now crusaders who will not be stopped by people refusing to comply.
You will be assimilated through the hammer and sickle masking the sword and shield.
It’s for the greater good, after all.
The memes are real, folks. We are the carbon they want to reduce. We are the livestock the think they can farm. The full force of their program to reduce us back to when we used to eat bugs to survive is here.
Is that the legacy you want to leave this world with?
If we don’t stop this here, there isn’t much room left to retreat. And if you doubt me, go talk to a farmer.
Think Global, Act Local just took on a raft of deeper meanings. It’s past time we put them into action.

justin truedoh it be obvious to many that something fundamental have change this wasn some davos crowd psy op like burn down minneapolis or million vagina march this be real awakening of the opposition to the great reset destroy the livelihood of the people who bring the good to our store be step too far even the most normalcy bias shitlib have to do double take at what be happen with the covid vaccine how do we get here so fast davos agenda have accelerate in recent month as major event force their hand from jerome powell war on the offshore dollar market to putin choose the whether he hang or we drown the pillar of their powerbase be crumble under the weight of their ambition most people can conceive of what these big shift actually mean sadly they still rely on what small amount of information they get from their overlord to form their opinion but that information have become so ludicrous so low quality it get enough people open to question they would have never contemplate previously it start and once the last vestige of trust in our medium melt away we ll see whole lot more than the protest we ve see to date yes thing can get bad that say the catalyst for europe farmer rise up be the crazy miscalculation of davos minion truedoh and his ukrainian diaspora bagwoman chrystia freeland freeze the account of trucker and trample peaceful protestor with horse wake way too many people up when you anger the bank radicalize normie and create nationwide bank run you set countdown timer on your rule first they come for the trucker to engineer supply crisis people support they in drove and be trample now they come for the dutch farmland to far engineer food crisis and the farmer take up the trucker flag the dutch farmer that be fight against the government didn erect flag of the netherland in their square but canadian flag an unstoppable movement be start in canada pic.twitter.com/hufpbaq92 for week ve wonder whether the spate of fire at food processing facility all across north america be sabotage or just the natural downstream effect of overworked people and under maintain equipment it fair point to consider rather then just go off half cock about evil of davos because in the end it doesn matter what the truth be likely mixture of both these breakdown be all their fault anyway thank that idiotic covid policy but how about fertilizer train derailment or thousand dead cow from heat prostration when the farmer revolution begin in the netherland realize this be something deep and be glad for it the great awakening that begin in ottawa and spread worldwide then have metastasize into real political nightmare for klaus schwab and his merry gang of nihilist midwit you know they be on auto pilot seize the land of efficient dutch farmer the netherlands be routinely praise by davos as kind of sustainable agriculture mecca so why go after they why not far demonize american farmer mean everyone just know americans be wasteful and dirty pig right and then come across the plan for tristate city and for it all click into place bankrupt the farmer through legislative fiat and seize their land to build the davos smart city of the future the perfect capitol of the corporatocracy try google anything about this connection and you ll find very little look at twitter search of tristate city and come to your own conclusion think minority report but with germans periodic revolution davos war against the periodic table continue unabated but notice how they aren go after truly poisonous element like mercury hg or thallium tl or even arsenic as fyi due to their extreme chemistry they be actually easy and cheap to deal with no they be go after the building block of life itself carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur or chnop we have the state goal of decarbonization worldwide phosphorus and nitrogen have be attack relentlessly as outgrowth of the war on chemical fertilizer smokestack emission etc for decade now our entire transport industry have be make less efficient raise the cost through unnecessary low sulfur diesel and bunker fuel rule now we re suppose to cheer lng power small dry weight tonnage ship as progress yeah 350 million boat for move good from jacksonville to puerto rico brilliant let use the most expensive fuel imaginable liquefy methane for ship an industry where fuel cost be literally everything but think fracke bad all under the rubric of clean air and buzzword like sustainability now all for clean environment and deal with real pollution which hamper human life and even the great ecosystem food web but cow produce nitrogen be part of the natural cycle of this essential element what next legislate away volcano anti transhumanism it all downstream of convince so many people to view themselves as pollutant and to separate human activity out as not natural think of the argument frame here and it very simple humanity be not part of the natural world our activity be not an outgrowth of nature pure design this be literally the argument about man make climate change too bad they have to define man energy input to the environment in the most idiotic and inaccurate way imaginable by ignore more than 90 of the energy the sun and the universe impart to our planet now add in the basic understanding that everyone have religion even atheist they just turn to worship something else they go from gather in church to courthouse cathedral to classroom and temple to tract house the bottom line folk be this everyone believe in something even nihilist but this anti humanism be far bad than any original sin doctrine of christianity there the message be that we be flawed but redeemable because we carry the spark of the divine within we the path to enlightenment be self discovery and self improvement there the existential threat be your own legacy nothing more it an inward journey now the climate religion have merge cynically with the hubris and colonialism of davos to create something horrific and deadly and since they have control over the sacred text now they be now crusader who will not be stop by people refuse to comply you will be assimilate through the hammer and sickle mask the sword and shield it for the great good after all the meme be real folk we be the carbon they want to reduce we be the livestock the think they can farm the full force of their program to reduce we back to when we use to eat bug to survive be here be that the legacy you want to leave this world with if we don stop this here there isn much room

50,3111,"West uses Ukraine as a testing ground for its weapons – and our resilience
","LPR completely liberated from terrorists
The dismantling of the terrorist organisation Ukraine is proceeding slowly but steadily. Those liberated from the terrorists are happy.
On Monday, Sergei Shoigu reported to Vladimir Putin on the liberation of the large industrial centre of Lysychansk and thus the cleansing of the entire Luhansk People’s Republic. The locals welcomed the troops of the Russian Federation and the militias of the Luhansk and Donetsk republics with literally tears of joy.
I openly remind the lovers of Western-believing media advertising, propaganda and disinformation: whoever shoots at civilians and not at armed forces, or hides behind civilians himself, is a terrorist. Ukraine even uses weapons and ammunition supplied by the collective West not on the troops, but on residential areas and life support facilities. The West is trying to pretend that it does not know.
A report by CNN reports that the effectiveness and accuracy of Western weapons are judged by reports of Russian TV channels reporting hits on residential and life-support buildings.
It is openly clear: the West is using Ukraine as a testing ground for its weapons – and our resilience.
On 7 July, the Russian president met with the leaders of the State Duma and its factions. He said in particular: “They – these measures imposed, illegal measures against Russia – create difficulties for us, an obvious fact, but not at all of the kind that the initiators of the economic blitzkrieg against Russia hoped for. Obviously, they were not just trying to hit the Russian economy harder – their aim was to sow discord, confusion in our society, to demoralise people. But they miscalculated here too: it has not worked and, I am sure, will not work.
The president explained in no uncertain terms why we would win. “They should have understood that they had already lost from the very beginning of our special military operation, because its beginning means the beginning of a radical breaking of the world order the American way. This is the beginning of the transition from liberal-globalist American egocentrism to a truly multipolar world …”.
I am openly convinced: no one will be able to crush the world, just as no one has ever managed to do it before.",west use ukraine as testing ground for its weapon and our resilience,"[(west, 'NNP'),

51,3139,"Liz Truss elected UK's new PM, faces tough job amid huge mess; 'pragmatic China ties crucial to overcome challenge'
","New Conservative Party leader and Britain's Prime Minister-elect Liz Truss delivers a speech at an event to announce the winner of the Conservative Party leadership contest in central London on September 5, 2022. 
Liz Truss will move in 10 Downing Street as she beat Rishi Sunak in the election on Monday to become the new leader of the Conservative Party and the new UK Prime Minister. Analysts believed that this would be a tough job for her as Britain is now facing complicated and serious internal and external challenges, such as inflation and the problem caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Truss officially won the Conservative Party leadership race on Monday, and according to the announced results, Truss won 81,326 votes compared to Sunak's share of 60,399 votes. There was a turnout of 82.6 percent in this election, BBC reported.
Truss thanked her controversial predecessor Boris Johnson in her speech after the result was announced. She praised Johnson of ""getting Brexit done"" and being tough toward Russia, according to the BBC report.
Observers believed the remarks show that she will continue Johnson's policies in foreign affairs, and it's possible she will take more radical and tougher actions in handling ties with the EU, Russia and China.
Truss will formally become the new prime minister of the UK on Tuesday when she visits the Queen in Balmoral for an invitation to form her UK government, the report said.
Some Chinese experts are concerned that Truss, who lacks experience and capability in governance, will bring huge uncertainty to future policymaking, and China-UK relations will also be impacted, stressing that stable and pragmatic ties with China are crucial for the UK to overcome challenges, and if the new government unwisely pushes further decoupling with China to please the US, it will only make the UK's mess even worse.
On Friday, three days ahead of the announcement of the new UK prime minister, Britain dropped behind India to become the world's sixth largest economy, according to GDP figures from the International Monetary Fund.
The former British colony leaped past the UK in the final three months of 2021 to become the fifth-biggest economy. The calculation is based in US dollars, and India extended its lead in the first quarter. The UK's decline in the international rankings is an unwelcome backdrop for the new prime minister, Bloomberg reported.
Chinese analysts said that Britain being surpassed by its former colony in terms of economy is a symbolic incident that proves the UK is declining badly and being further marginalized in Europe. This also shows that London's policy that closely follows US', to serve Washington's strategy in dealing with other major powers like the EU, Russia and China, is bringing no concrete benefit to Britain, and it also can't stop the UK's post-Brexit mess from worsening.
Truss is likely to face the most challenging set of circumstances of any prime minister since Margaret Thatcher, said the Times on Monday. The biggest issue for the new prime minister is the cost of living crisis and Truss looks set to respond by ripping up 20 years of economic orthodoxy.
Soaring inflation, energy bills and the price of food have prompted warnings of households going cold and hungry this winter, said the Times report.
The current unprecedented shambles resulted from a series of negative incidents including Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine crisis and are extremely challenging for any new leader to solve, Wang Shuo, a professor at the School of International Relations of Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Monday.
Wang said Truss' hawkish language on China during the campaign came from the fact that Truss perfectly knew that she is not capable to solve UK's domestic problems such as inflation or the energy crisis.
""Shirking one's responsibility is the simplest and most effective way for an incompetent politician. By blaming and criticizing China and Russia harshly, just as what Truss always does, it is actually saying: All the problems we have in the UK are the fault of China and Russia instead of the inability of the country's governors,"" Wang pointed out.
Yin Zhiguang, a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs under Fudan University, told the Global Times on Monday that the Conservative Party is impossible to review or reform the current development model, so the new prime minister will likely use political approaches to solve economic problems.
""Truss' idea of tax cut is actually unrealistic, especially when the economy is declining under multiple challenges like inflation and energy crisis. How to get money will be the key problem for the new government,"" Yin said.
Apart from seeking opportunities from involving in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, London would further strengthen the trans-Atlantic alliance with the US, to seek possibilities of solving economic problems from making the UK a stronghold for Washington to involve the issues in Europe and Asia, Yin said.
Based on the difficulties that the UK is facing now and the performance of Truss in the past when she served in other positions in the British government, the international community, whether in the Western or non-Western world, share concerns over the change she could bring to the UK.
US media Politico said earlier on August 23 that ""More than a dozen conversations with senior diplomats and insiders from power centers around the world suggest Truss is not exactly a popular choice on the global stage.""
Truss will be met with deep skepticism across much of Western Europe, and within the Biden administration, because her stance in handling post-Brexit trade ties with Europe and her sponsorship of the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill could impact the hard-won peace in Ireland, said Politico.
China is also concerned about the potential changes that might be brought by the new UK government, since Truss could appoint some extreme anti-China politicians to handle foreign affairs and national security, so under pressure from the US, London could be more assertive in decoupling with China, and use Hong Kong or Xinjiang as pretexts to suspend or cut off existing cooperation, Yin said.
If a hostile policy toward China has been implemented by Truss, it serves the interest of Truss herself rather than the UK, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Monday.
In order to please not only Washington, but also the sick political correctness of anti-China and anti-Russia stance spreading across the Western world, ""Truss is very likely to politically and diplomatically take a tough stance toward China in the short term due to her dubious governing capacity,"" Cui said.
""But in the long run, after some frictions, Truss may learn to be pragmatic and return to a balanced position, just as what her predecessors Theresa May and Boris Johnson did in handling ties with China - being tough on diplomatic and political fronts but maintaining trade and economic cooperation,"" Cui noted.
Wang echoed that ""as long as doing business with China can bring benefits to the capitalists of the UK, the country's cooperation with China will be unstoppable. So the key is not about whether UK politicians like China or not, it's about whether the cooperation is beneficial.""

52,3138,"US debt surpasses $31 trillion
","The US national debt has officially exceeded $31 trillion for the first time in history, the Treasury Department confirmed on Tuesday.
The US government owed a total of 31 trillion, 123 billion, 887 million, 781 thousand, 401 dollars and 34 cents as of October 3, according to publicly released Treasury figures.
At the moment of President Joe Biden’s inauguration, in January 2021, the debt stood at $27,75 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service.
“It was $21 trillion just five years ago,”Congressman Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, lamented on Twitter after the news broke.
The national debt stood at $19.94 trillion when President Donald Trump took office in 2017, and exploded in the past few years as the Federal Reserve printed money to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.
Most of the debt is held by private individuals, to the tune of $24 trillion, while debts to foreign governments amount to almost $7 trillion. Much of the world indirectly subsidizes the US dollar as the global reserve currency.
Meanwhile, the featured announcement on Treasury’s website on Tuesday concerned the establishment of a 25-member Advisory Committee on Racial Equity, which is supposed to “provide advice and recommendations to Secretary Yellen and Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo on efforts to advance racial equity in the economy and address acute disparities for communities of color.”

53,3110,"NESBIT: The US Must Fully Embrace Nuclear Power To Achieve True Energy Security
","Editor’s note: We endeavor to bring you the top voices on current events representing a range of perspectives. Below is a column arguing that the U.S. must fully embrace nuclear power to achieve energy security. You can find a counterpoint here, where Steve Milloy argues that the U.S. should unleash its full fossil fuel potential to achieve energy independence.
The outcome of Russia’s brutal attempt to conquer the valiant nation of Ukraine hangs in the balance, but it is not too soon to discuss strategic steps that we can and should take based on this stark reminder that other countries do not always play nice. Energy has an outsized role in the Russia-Ukraine war. The sale of Russian oil and gas has financed the Kremlin and its 20 years of aggressions against its neighbors and its own people. European democracies are addicted to Russia’s hydrocarbons, and it will take years to break them of their dependency. To its credit, Europe finally seems to be waking up to the menace posed by the unpredictable bear next door.
The key takeaway is that energy security is not to be taken for granted. Some European countries (Germany, Belgium and Spain) plan to or are in the process of shutting down nuclear power plants to assuage the Green Party. They are left with intermittent renewable power backed up by burning coal and natural gas, which emit large quantities of the very greenhouse gases those countries seek to avoid. Unwisely, they rely on Russia for much of their oil and gas, which puts those European countries in a vulnerable situation when the bear acts up. In contrast, America is blessed with abundant coal, oil and natural gas, thanks in large part to the shale gas revolution. Renewable electricity generation continues to grow rapidly, adding to the diversity of electricity supply. We are not overly reliant on any single foreign power for our energy. Can we not just continue to do what we have been doing?
Unfortunately, no. Being in a good place today is not the same as being in a good place 20 years down the road. There is an undeniable need to transition to clean energy sources. Moreover, America’s supply of hydrocarbons, while ample for current needs, is inherently finite. Burning oil and gas to make electricity today is hardly the best strategic use of our resources; we should conserve those hydrocarbons for applications like petrochemicals and certain kinds of transportation, like air travel. Subsidized electricity generation from wind and solar power has grown tremendously over the past two decades, but even taken together wind and solar are still not the number one source of clean electricity in this country. Nuclear power is.
Fortunately, the United States is well-situated to build on its solid foundation in nuclear energy to enable a clean and reliable energy future. From its humble beginnings powering four light bulbs near Arco, Idaho in 1951, nuclear power has become the baseload electricity workhorse in many parts of the country. Today 93 nuclear power reactors provide approximately 20% of the country’s electricity. The plants operate around the clock and all year long to produce power when Americans need it, without harmful emissions. Unlike renewable energy, nuclear power plants run when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing. From a security perspective, nuclear power plants run 18-24 months between refueling, and they can store years of fresh fuel on site, making them resistant to transportation bottlenecks and short-term supply interruptions. Uranium for nuclear fuel is plentiful and available domestically as well as from stable, reliable allies, most notably Canada and Australia.
That’s the situation today, but what about the future? Two state-of-the-art large light water reactors are nearing completion in Georgia, and private industry and the government are funding research, development and deployment of exciting new advanced reactor designs that incorporate inherent safety features and additional capabilities beyond those of current reactors. Many will operate at high temperatures that enable more efficient electricity production; those high temperatures also support essential non-electricity industrial applications such as process steam for industry and hydrogen production. This opens up the possibility of decarbonizing industry as well as electricity. New designs are also better suited for meshing with variable wind and solar generation, thereby helping to mitigate grid reliability concerns. The NuScale small modular reactor already received design certification approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Applications for a number of other designs will be under NRC review shortly. We look forward to deployments of new advanced reactors beginning later this decade.
All sources of energy have their advantages and disadvantages. The need to transition to clean energy is evident, and all technologies — including nuclear, renewables, fossil with carbon capture and hydroelectric — should be deployed where feasible and economic. The nuclear technology world seeks a level playing field, without subsidies for “favored” sources and with appropriate monetization for essential attributes like security, reliability, avoided emissions, and the ability to provide generation when needed. There is no substitute for plentiful and affordable energy, and we need to make smart choices now to ensure America has it in the future.
