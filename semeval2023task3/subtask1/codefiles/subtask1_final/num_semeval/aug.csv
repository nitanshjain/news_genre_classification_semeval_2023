76,hey remember five minute ago when the francis shout at reporter in chile that there be no evidence support complaint against his good friend bishop juan barros and just for good measure he accuse the people accuse he victim of sexual abuse by barros mentor the convict sex predator karadima of commit calumny and retreat when cardinal malley tell the pope off in public over the pain these accusation have cause the victim of sexual abuse and then remember how the pope have apologise except not really because the accusation be after all still lie and that there still no evidence against barros the press secular as well as catholic be full this week of the story that the pope do indeed see evidence of barros complicity in karadima sexual abuse not only that barro have help to cover it up but that he have be present and direct witness at the time and therefore passive participant nicole winfield and the associated press drop the bomb that the information come directly from the victim whom francis have dismiss and refuse to meet with on his trip and deliver through his own testimony on sexual abuse pope francis receive victim letter in 2015 that graphically detail how priest sexually abuse he and how other chilean clergy ignore it contradict the pope recent insistence that no victim have come forward to denounce the cover up the letter author and member of francis own sex abuse commission have tell the associated press the fact that francis receive the eight page letter obtain by the ap challenge his insistence that he have zero tolerance for sex abuse and cover up it also call into question his state empathy with abuse survivor compound the most serious crisis of his five year papacy now it appear that francis have also overrule 2015 warning from the congregation for the doctrine of the faith that barro should not be make bishop the italian catholic daily la nuova bussola quotidiana report that not only do the pope see letter from victim but that the cdf under muller have already conduct an preliminary investigation into barro and the other bishop close to karadima which have lead to the decision to relieve they of their duty but with letter sign by the pope in january 2015 and send to the chilean bishop the request for exemption be block and shortly thereafter barro be promote to osorno the article point out that while karadima be convict by vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victim it be the same testimony of the same victim witness that francis now dismiss in the accusation against barro the accusation that stand against karadima come from the same source as those against barro who the victim say be in the room watch at the time while the specific be still not know reader may be remind by this of peculiar incident about year later in which pope francis summarily order the dismissal of three priest of the cdf whose remit be investigation of cleric accuse of sexual abuse the website one peter five report via marco tosatti that the pope order their removal without offer any explanation to then cardinal prefect gerhard muller when after several attempt and three month later muller be able to get an audience with the pope to ask the reason he receive the response be the pope do not need to give reason for any of my decision have decide that they have to leave and they have to leave marco tosatti report the cdf incident but it follow an odd story of meeting of curial official to discuss certain bishop appointment without name name or frustratingly give date tosatti relate it be some time ago to make bishop not in italy the nuncio have prepare the triad the terna or list of three candidate cardinal head of the dicastery perhaps the same holder of the congregation for bishop during the ordinary assembly take the floor say the first candidate indicate be excellent the second be good but would like to warn of the third whom know well since he be seminarian and who present problem both on the level of doctrine and morality he respond little to the necessary criterion but the third be friend of someone and another cardinal of the circle currently in power have fling himself at his colleague accuse he of impropriety the meeting end without further decision whatever the detail of these strange incident what be clear in chile be that no amount of eyewitness testimony be go to make the slight difference bergoglio want barro as bishop and that be that even while apologise the pope have double down when question about it by journalist say you in all good will tell that there be victim but haven see any because they haven come forward in the case of barro it be observe it be study there no evidence the good thing to do if someone believe it the case be to come forward quickly with evidence the ap report however say exactly the opposite that member of his own now defunct abuse commission have approach cardinal malley the pope top abuse advisor with the letter to deliver to the pope marie collins the irish abuse survivor and commission member who resign cite the vatican refusal to take meaningful action tell ap when we give he malley the letter for the pope he assure we he would give it to the pope and speak of the concern and at later date he assure we that that have be do juan carlos cruz the karadima victim whose membership on the commission the vatican have block tell ap cardinal malley call after the pope visit here in philadelphia and he tell among other thing that he have give the letter to the pope in his hand on the face of it there be only few logical possibility here in fact unless cardinal malley who have as of this writing remain silent come forward and say that he didn hand the letter over pope there be really only one that the pope lie and this be what be now be say quite openly by vast array of voice secular and catholic left and right as winfield write the revelation could be costly for francis whose track record on the abuse crisis be already shaky after botched italian abuse case he intervene in become public more recently he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year vatican analyst now openly question whether he get it and some of his own adviser privately acknowledge that maybe he doesn no evidence lie big lie often and when catch keep lie one of the many thing these secular reporter seem not to be pay attention to be that no evidence be in fact well rehearse stock response for bergoglio he say almost exactly the same in 2013 when confront about another predatory homosexual he be shelter the hoopla surround the who be to judge comment tend to obscure the context of the comment it be make in response to question by journalist about monsignore battista ricca prelate whose promiscuous homosexuality be so well know it be cover by the telegraph as early as july 2013 ilze scamparini ask the pope about ricca say what you intend to do about this how be you confront this issue and how do your holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby what reply do bergoglio give his standard one no evidence about monsignor ricca do what canon law call for that be preliminary investigation and from this investigation there be nothing of what have be allege we do not find anything of that this be the response he add in this case conduct the preliminary investigation and we didn find anything but ricca activity for which the pope claim there be no evidence be notorious they include be catch in flagrante in an elevator with teenaged male prostitute and his sexual relationship with captain in the swiss army so flagrant be ricca behaviour that it take intervention by uruguay nuncio to have he remove it be report in 1999 and 2000 by espresso who say the information be confirm by numerous bishop priest religious and laity in uruguay in fact the evidence show that ricca be completely in line with bergoglio normal procedure as marcantonio colonna write in the dictator pope in fact his patronage of monsignor ricca fit the pattern which be well establish when he be archbishop of bueno aire whereby he surround himself with morally weak people so as to have they under his thumb it be at this early no evidence comment on the plane home from rio that some of those pay attention start to understand that bergoglio policy be in line with that of certain leader of the past who recommend that if politician be go to lie he should lie big and lie brazenly and in case anyone be wonder what will happen next the same advice say to keep on lie after you re catch the pattern of silence and when press flat out denial have be bergoglio policy since long before he come on the international scene he have long record in argentina of shaving close to scandal and vociferously deny involvement and rely heavily on the broad good will of catholic towards bishop to pull it off perhaps his big error with barro be fail to understand just how little of that capital of trust there be leave in the catholic world as whole indeed on the subject of priest sexually abuse young people it could only be measure in the negative number argentine victim who try to meet with pope francis though the website bishop accountability be blatantly anti clerical their data be unassailable since most of it come from information that be already public on their argentina page be long list of accusation that bergoglio francis simply isn interested in hear from victim in pope francis 21 year as bishop and archbishop of bueno air the wall street journal report include the year when he head the argentine bishop conference he decline to meet with victim of sexual abuse all of they try to contact the cardinal archbishop in 2002 or later the same period when pope benedict and other bishop be strive to meet with victim and demonstrate an interest in the problem the site say that in addition to bergoglio failure to respond to victim the public record contain no evidence that he release any information about abuser in fact he go so far as to flatly deny there have be any instance of abuse in his archdiocese week after his election to the papacy he be quote by his close friend rabbi abraham skorka in my diocese it never happen to but bishop call once by phone to ask what to do in situation like this francis add that he agree with the zero tolerance attitude of the irish episcopate and admired pope benedict reform most of which he be later to quietly reverse it be at exactly this time however that victim from argentina be attempt to get the new pope attention one know to the press only as gabriel want to talk to francis about the sexual abuse he suffer at the hand of julio cesar grassi accuse of molest at least five boy who have be avoid the sentence of the justice of moron and the court of cassation so far judge and prosecutor at all instance find he guilty in case anyone think the grassi gabriel case be not serious enough for the pope attention bishop accountability summarise year after gabriel have file criminal charge 2003 but before the start of grassi trial three man ransack the survivor apartment and beat he these man threaten to kill he if he do not retract his testimony and quit the case ten year after gabriel file criminal charge in may 2013 with grassi still free despite his conviction in 2009 gabriel and his attorney juan pablo gallego bring two page letter address to pope francis to the office of the papal nuncio in bueno air an employee refuse to accept the letter after learn of its topic and threaten to call security if gabriel and gallego do not leave the premise the group surmise that it be bergoglio direct intervention with judge in the case that prevent conviction against grassi for so long and delay his sentencing through multiple appeal in 2006 then archbishop bergoglio complain of media campaign and claim that the grassi case be different from other accusation during his criminal trial grassi say bergoglio never let go of his hand in 2009 grassi be convict of two count of aggravate sexual assault and corruption in the case of gabriel who be age 13 at the time of the abuse but the appeal drag on until he be finally send to prison in september 2013 several more similar case all of whom be rebuff in their attempt to meet with bergoglio be detail here for the strong of stomach virtuoso performance liar look back and carefully examine his record jorge bergoglio mastery of use the weakness of morally compromise man be become evident it be arguable that even the member of the so call san gallen mafia who apparently conspire to put he on peter throne be use by he but he be also master of judge an audience and tell they what they expect to hear key skill for all grifter and confidence trickster look carefully at the infamous who be to judge comment this be clear early on the first part of that interview be blatant and enormous lie and it be from there that the pope move on to his apology for homosexuality in general recall that this be the very first airplane interview on the trip back to rome from world youth day in rio matter of week after his election at the time the papal apologist spring instantly into action and we hear all about how the pope be talk strictly within the boundary of catholic doctrine but perhaps in hindsight we be ready to examine the full implication of his little speech one that be clearly well rehearse don forget no question be ask in papal interview without be thoroughly vet ahead of time journalist must submit their question well in advance this be the pope lay out his policy regard homosexuality policy for which he be duly reward by be laud on the cover of the homosexualist lobby we trade magazine read his full answer carefully see that many time in the church over and above this case but include this case people search for sin from youth for example and then publish they they be not crime right crime be something different the abuse of minor be crime no sin but if person whether it be lay person priest or religious sister commit sin and then convert the lord forgive and when the lord forgive the lord forget and this be very important for our life when we confess our sin and we truly say have sin in this the lord forget and so we have no right not to forget because otherwise we would run the risk of the lord not forget our sin that be danger this be important theology of sin many time think of saint peter he commit one of the bad sin that be he deny christ and even with this sin they make he pope we have to think great deal about that but return to your question more concretely in this case conduct the preliminary investigation and we didn find anything this be the first question then you speak about the gay lobby so much be write about the gay lobby still haven find anyone with an identity card in the vatican with gay on it they say there be some there believe that when you be deal with such person you must distinguish between the fact of person be gay and the fact of someone form lobby because not all lobby be good this one be not good if someone be gay and be search for the lord and have good will then who be to judge he the catechism of the catholic church explain this in beautiful way say wait moment how do it say it it say no one should marginalize these people for this they must be integrate into society the problem be not have this tendency no we must be brother and sister to one another and there be this one and there be that one the problem be in make lobby of this tendency lobby of miser lobby of politician lobby of mason so many lobby for this be the great problem thank you so much for ask this question many thank one of the pope favourite rhetorical technique be combination of beg the question and conspiracy he start by assume without any effort at defence or explanation point that concede the whole issue this be the first time pope have ever use the political term gay not homosexual not same sex attract but gay meaning that he start by adopt the entirety of the homosexualist movement linguistic manipulation language count in politic and pope use that term mean he be by implication start the discussion and his pontificate by align himself with the basic tenet of movement that be violently opposed to catholic moral teaching and in direct opposition to his immediate and still live predecessor in this case too he be address plane load of journalist who be either secular themselves or for the most part be the kind of catholic who believe it be fine to disagree with catholic teaching on sexuality there be very few conservative catholic in the vatican journalist pool this mean that his use of this language be conspiratorial wink and nod to his immediate audience sly message to say people talk all the time about gay lobby but you and both know this be mostly nonsense propaganda from those people those conservative we cool and hip people don hate gay do we this astonishing departure follow an implied but very clear assertion that ricca have repent and give up his activity an assertion that have absolutely no evidence to back it up we be simply ask to take the pope word for it but give that it follow his astoundingly brazen lie that there be no evidence for ricca homosexual activity in the first place we can take the assurance for what it seem to be worth next after another little inside nudge nudge wink wink joke about the gay lobby implying but of course never outright say that the whole thing be hysterical nonsense we hear direct contradiction to catholic teaching from no less source than his predecessor pope benedict ratzinger the problem be not have this tendency well actually your holiness yes it be particularly in the case of priest the tendency be call in the same catechism you quote intrinsically disorder and ratzinger be very clear that this tendency be sign of serious emotional dysfunction that must preclude man from be ordain squander the capital of trust few month ago in piece for the remnant talk about why the church and nearly all human society regard lie as sin mistake many make about lie be to understand it only in term of morality but thomas make the point that it be first matter of metaphysic lie be an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality thomistic theology teach that it be by lie that we become most like the devil and most unlike god because we be try to change the nature of reality to suit our own purpose habitual lie in effect change you into different kind of be one that be by nature an opponent of truth order against truth this of course mean that person whose orientation as we might say be towards falsehood even when he be at any give moment say something true be still service his lie he tell the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality it be not by violence but by lie and manipulation by issue half truth and pretend to be the kind of man he be not that shakespeare character iago earn the title of most evil character in english literature human being be naturally order towards the truth and we have to work at assume lie this be why confidence trickster can be successful why lie work for get what you want people don see it come the first natural assumption be trust at least at the basic level of expect truth most of the time we therefore instinctively see lie as betrayal of trust consider how much trust the catholic faithful have in the papacy until about 1965 how much un earn trust francis start with just by be elect this pontificate should be remember as one of the great confidence scam in history believe catholic have watch aghast as this pope have habitually trample on every aspect of catholic teaching sandro magister recently publish piece on his website that list in dizzying detail the many time in only the last few month that pope francis have falsify with obvious intention the word of christ in scripture and the teaching of the church of course this would be of little interest to secular journalist who have pay no mind to his habit of rewrite catholicism but the sex abuse crisis be something secular journalist be very interested in fact bergoglio seem not to have understand it be now irrefutable that pope bergoglio be habitual liar that in fact truth like reality seem to mean nothing to he except as tool sociologist talk about the concept of the high trust society one in which citizen believe what they be tell by the elite and trust they to govern and protect they adequately they warn that the general loss of trust in institution lead to general state of chaos in which law on the book matter little as citizen turn to their last resort of protect themselves and their own family this be the way society disintegrate it have be say many time that the sex abuse crisis have create massive loss of trust in prelate among the catholic faithful and this be true with professional confidence trickster on the papal throne blatantly use lie and manipulation to maintain power and ram through an agenda at radical variance with catholic doctrine how long before that predictable disintegration occur be we see it already be we see it in the declaration of this or that episcopate on amoris laetitia and communion for divorced and civilly remarry catholic with cardinal marx and other promote blessing for same sex union be we go to be see an escalation of it have see veritable chorus of catholic on social medium declare that if paul vi be canonise their loss of faith in the church as an institution will be complete be tell from contact inside the vatican that after the trip to chile bergoglio support have completely dry up he have no more resource of trust even among the people he have choose to surround himself with and after the report of cardinal sandri go toe to toe with he in shout match it seem that perhaps even his legendary vicious temper tantrum be fail to have the desire effect of terrorise his subordinate into submission marie collin by no stretch even conservative catholic echo this concern say the barros affair have definitely undermine credibility trust and hope in francis all can say be that people who have lot of hope in this particular pope and be talk about just ordinary catholic that know in my own parish would find it very difficult now and can not understand and can not believe that this particular pope have say the thing he have say in the last few week she tell the national catholic reporter it may seem like moment to enjoy see the apparently unbreachable shell of papal teflon finally crack but in reality this situation be potentially very harmful for soul in the long run there be multitude of problem this pontificate have create or make bad that we will be deal with for long time after bergoglio be go but perhaps one of the big one will be the destruction of trust already fracture since the collapse of all catholic institution after vatican ii and the horror of the sex abuse crisis how much will there be to repair of the once steadfast trust catholic instinctively have in the church after this note not one victim have come forward in chile show the proof this be slander and calumny be that clear the book the dictator pope relate that regular meeting between the pope and dicastery head have be abolish and even high rank curia prefect be often unable to see the pope whose appointment be now completely control by the secretariat of state it be certainly clear that no one see the pope unless cardinal parolin approve which may be the reason cardinal zen in his effort to warn francis of the danger of vatican deal with the communist chinese government have to wait in the rain at wednesday general audience this be common in italian journalism that have somewhat different standard from that of the anglo world and drive the rest of we spare italians care about get general picture of what go on where anglo saxon be consider weirdly obsess with trivial detail though she never blame the pope marie collins complain that vatican officialdom have simply not implement the commission recommendation the time limit of the commission member be allow to lapse without renewal and though it be not dissolve formally the commission have cease to function with no word of any plan to revive it probably reference to the inzoli case in which francis overturn previous sentence of vatican tribunal after the priest now laicised approach some of the pope close advisor for help include cardinal coccopalmerio not that anyone in rome be try very hard sandro magister report after the who be to judge comment before the appointment francis have be show as be customary the personal file on ricca in which he have not find anything unseemly he have also hear from various personality of the curia and none of they have raise objectionspecial report papal cover up allege pope accuse in international sex abuse case,1
77,hey remember five minute ago when pope francis shout at reporter in chile that there be no evidence support complaint against his good friend bishop juan barros and just for good measure he accuse the people accuse he victim of sexual abuse by barros mentor the convict sex predator karadima of commit calumny and remember when cardinal malley tell the pope off in public over the pain these accusation have cause the victim of sexual abuse and then remember how the pope have apologise except not really because the accusation be after all still lie and that there still no evidence against barros the press secular as well as catholic be full this week of the story that the pope do indeed see evidence of barros complicity in karadima sexual abuse not only that barro have help to cover it up but that he have be present and direct witness at the time and therefore passive participant nicole winfield and the associated press drop the bomb that the information come directly from the victim whom francis have dismiss and refuse to meet with on his trip and deliver through his own commission on sexual abuse pope francis receive victim letter in 2015 that graphically detail how priest sexually abuse he and how other chilean clergy react it contradict the pope recent insistence that no victim have come forward to denounce the cover up the letter author and member of francis own sex abuse commission have tell the associated press the fact that francis receive the eight page letter obtain by the ap challenge his insistence that he have zero tolerance for sex abuse and cover up it also call into question his state empathy with abuse survivor compound the most serious crisis of his five year papacy now it appear that francis have also overrule 2015 warning from the congregation for the doctrine of the faith that barro should not be make bishop the italian catholic daily la nuova bussola analysis report that not only do the pope see letter from victim but that the cdf under muller have already conduct an preliminary investigation into barro and the other bishop close to karadima which have lead to the decision to relieve they of their duty but with letter sign by the pope in january 2015 and send to the chilean bishop the request for exemption be block and shortly thereafter barro be promote to osorno the article point out even while karadima be convict by vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victim it be the same testimony of the same victim witness that francis now dismiss in the accusation against barro the accusation that stand against karadima come from the same source as those against barro who the victim say be in the room watch at the time while the specific be still not know reader may be remind by this of peculiar incident about year later in which pope francis summarily order the dismissal of three priest of the cdf whose remit be investigation of cleric accuse of sexual abuse the website one peter five report via marco tosatti that the pope order their removal without offer any explanation to then cardinal prefect gerhard muller when after several attempt and three month later muller be able to get an audience with the pope to ask the reason he receive the response be the pope do not need to give reason for any of my decision have decide that they have to leave and they have to leave marco tosatti report the cdf incident but it follow an odd story of meeting of curial official to discuss certain bishop appointment without name name or frustratingly give date tosatti relate it be some time ago to make bishop not in italy the nuncio have prepare the triad the terna or list of three candidate cardinal head of the dicastery perhaps the same holder of the congregation for bishop during the ordinary assembly take the floor say the first candidate indicate be excellent the second be good but would like to warn of the third whom know well since he be seminarian and who present problem both on the level of doctrine and morality he respond little to the necessary criterion but the third be friend of someone and another cardinal of the circle currently in power have fling himself at his colleague accuse he of impropriety the meeting end without further decision whatever the detail of these strange incident what be clear in chile be that no amount of eyewitness testimony be go to make the slight difference bergoglio want barro as bishop and that be that even while apologise the pope have double down when question about it by journalist say you in all good will tell that there be victim but haven see any because they haven come forward in the case of barro it be observe it be study there no evidence the good thing to do if someone believe it the case be to come forward quickly with evidence the ap report however say exactly the opposite that member of his own now defunct abuse commission have approach cardinal malley the pope top abuse advisor with the letter to deliver to the pope marie collins the irish abuse survivor and commission member who resign cite the vatican refusal to take meaningful action tell ap when we give he malley the letter for the pope he assure we he would give it to the pope and speak of the concern and at later date he assure we that that have be do juan carlos cruz the karadima victim whose membership on the commission the vatican have block tell ap cardinal malley call after the pope visit here in philadelphia and he tell among other thing that he have give the letter to the pope in his hand on the face of it there be only few logical possibility here in fact unless cardinal malley who have as of this writing remain silent come forward and say that he didn hand the letter over pope there be really only one that the pope lie and this be what be now be say quite openly by vast array of voice secular and catholic left and right as winfield write the revelation could be costly for francis whose track record on the abuse crisis be already shaky after botched italian abuse case he intervene in become public more recently he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year vatican analyst now openly question whether he get it and some of his own adviser privately acknowledge that maybe he doesn no evidence lie big lie often and when catch keep lie one of the many thing these secular reporter seem not to be pay attention to be that no evidence be in fact well rehearse stock response for bergoglio he say almost exactly the same in 2013 when confront about another predatory homosexual he be shelter the hoopla surround the who be to judge comment tend to obscure the context of the comment it be make in response to question by journalist about monsignore battista ricca prelate whose promiscuous homosexuality be so well know it be cover by the telegraph as early as july 2013 ilze scamparini ask the pope about ricca say what you intend to do about this how be you confront this issue and how do your holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby what reply do bergoglio give his standard one no evidence about monsignor ricca do what canon law call for that be preliminary investigation and from this investigation there be nothing of what have be allege we do not find anything of that this be the response he add in this case conduct the preliminary investigation and we didn find anything but ricca activity for which the pope claim there be no evidence be notorious they include be catch in flagrante in an elevator with teenaged male prostitute and his sexual relationship with captain in the swiss army so flagrant be ricca behaviour that it take intervention by uruguay nuncio to have he remove it be report in 1999 and 2000 by espresso who say the information be confirm by numerous bishop priest religious and laity in uruguay in fact the evidence show that ricca be completely in line with bergoglio normal procedure as marcantonio colonna write in the dictator pope in fact his patronage of monsignor ricca fit the pattern which be well establish when he be archbishop of bueno aire whereby he surround himself with morally weak people so as to have they under his thumb it be at this early no evidence comment on the plane home from rio that some of those pay attention start to understand that bergoglio policy be in line with that of certain leader of the past who recommend that if politician be go to lie he should lie big and lie brazenly and in case anyone be wonder what will happen next the same advice say to keep on lie after you re catch the pattern of silence and when press flat out denial have be bergoglio policy since long before he come on the international scene he have long record in argentina of shaving close to scandal and vociferously deny involvement and rely heavily on the broad good will of catholic towards bishop to pull it off perhaps his big error with barro be fail to understand just how little of that capital of trust there be leave in the catholic world as whole indeed on the subject of priest sexually abuse young people it could only be measure in the negative number argentine victim who try to meet with pope francis though the website bishop accountability be blatantly anti clerical their data be unassailable since most of it come from information that be already public on their argentina page be long list of accusation that bergoglio francis simply isn interested in hear from victim in pope francis 21 year as bishop and archbishop of bueno air the wall street journal report include the year when he head the argentine bishop conference he decline to meet with victim of sexual abuse all of they try to contact the cardinal archbishop in 2002 or later the same period when pope benedict and other bishop be strive to meet with victim and demonstrate an interest in the problem the site say that in addition to bergoglio failure to respond to victim the public record contain no evidence that he release any information about abuser in fact he go so far as to flatly deny there have be any instance of abuse in his archdiocese week after his election to the papacy he be quote by his close friend rabbi abraham skorka in my diocese it never happen to but bishop call once by phone to ask what to do in situation like this francis add that he agree with the zero tolerance attitude of the irish episcopate and admired pope benedict reform most of which he be later to quietly reverse it be at exactly this time however that victim from argentina be attempt to get the new pope attention one know to the press only as gabriel want to talk to francis about the sexual abuse he suffer at the hand of julio cesar grassi accuse of molest at least five boy who have be avoid the sentence of the justice of moron and the court of cassation so far judge and prosecutor at all instance find he guilty in case anyone think the grassi gabriel case be not serious enough for the pope attention bishop accountability summarise year after gabriel have file criminal charge 2003 but before the start of grassi trial three man ransack the survivor apartment and beat he these man threaten to kill he if he do not retract his testimony and quit the case ten year after gabriel file criminal charge in may 2013 with grassi still free despite his conviction in 2009 gabriel and his attorney juan pablo gallego bring two page letter address to pope francis to the office of the papal nuncio in bueno air an employee refuse to accept the letter after learn of its topic and threaten to call security if gabriel and gallego do not leave the premise the group surmise that it be bergoglio direct intervention with judge in the case that prevent conviction against grassi for so long and delay his sentencing through multiple appeal in 2006 then archbishop bergoglio complain of media campaign and claim that the grassi case be different from other accusation during his criminal trial grassi say bergoglio never let go of his hand in 2009 grassi be convict of two count of aggravate sexual assault and corruption in the case of gabriel who be age 13 at the time of the abuse but the appeal drag on until he be finally send to prison in september 2013 several more similar case all of whom be rebuff in their attempt to meet with bergoglio be detail here for the strong of stomach virtuoso performance liar look back and carefully examine his record jorge bergoglio mastery of use the weakness of morally compromise man be become evident it be arguable that even the member of the so call san gallen mafia who apparently conspire to put he on peter throne be use by he but he be also master of judge an audience and tell they what they expect to hear key skill for all grifter and confidence trickster look carefully at the infamous who be to judge comment this be clear early on the first part of that interview be blatant and enormous lie and it be from there that the pope move on to his apology for homosexuality in general recall that this be the very first airplane interview on the trip back to rome from world youth day in rio matter of week after his election at the time the papal apologist spring instantly into action and we hear all about how the pope be talk strictly within the boundary of catholic doctrine but perhaps in hindsight we be ready to examine the full implication of his little speech one that be clearly well rehearse don forget no question be ask in papal interview without be thoroughly vet ahead of time journalist must submit their question well in advance this be the pope lay out his policy regard homosexuality policy for which he be duly reward by be laud on the cover of the homosexualist lobby we trade magazine read his full answer carefully see that many time in the church over and above this case but include this case people search for sin from youth for example and then publish they they be not crime right crime be something different the abuse of minor be crime no sin but if person whether it be lay person priest or religious sister commit sin and then convert the lord forgive and when the lord forgive the lord forget and this be very important for our life when we confess our sin and we truly say have sin in this the lord forget and so we have no right not to forget because otherwise we would run the risk of the lord not forget our sin that be danger this be important theology of sin many time think of saint peter he commit one of the bad sin that be he deny christ and even with this sin they make he pope we have to think great deal about that but return to your question more concretely in this case conduct the preliminary investigation and we didn find anything this be the first question then you speak about the gay lobby so much be write about the gay lobby still haven find anyone with an identity card in the vatican with gay on it they say there be some there believe that when you be deal with such person you must distinguish between the fact of person be gay and the fact of someone form lobby because not all lobby be good this one be not good if someone be gay and be search for the lord and have good will then who be to judge he the catechism of the catholic church explain this in beautiful way say wait moment how do it say it it say no one should marginalize these people for this they must be integrate into society the problem be not have this tendency no we must be brother and sister to one another and there be this one and there be that one the problem be in make lobby of this tendency lobby of miser lobby of politician lobby of mason so many lobby for this be the great problem thank you so much for ask this question many thank one of the pope favourite rhetorical technique be combination of beg the question and conspiracy he start by assume without any effort at defence or explanation point that concede the whole issue this be the first time pope have ever use the political term gay not homosexual not same sex attract but gay meaning that he start by adopt the entirety of the homosexualist movement linguistic manipulation language count in politic and pope use that term mean he be by implication start the discussion and his pontificate by align himself with the basic tenet of movement that be violently opposed to catholic moral teaching and in direct opposition to his immediate and still live predecessor in this case too he be address plane load of journalist who be either secular themselves or for the most part be the kind of catholic who believe it be fine to disagree with catholic teaching on sexuality there be very few conservative catholic in the vatican journalist pool this mean that his use of this language be conspiratorial wink and nod to his immediate audience sly message to say people talk all the time about gay lobby but you and both know this be mostly nonsense propaganda from those people those conservative we cool and hip people don hate gay do we this astonishing departure follow an implied but very clear assertion that ricca have repent and give up his activity an assertion that have absolutely no evidence to back it up we be simply ask to take the pope word for it but give that it follow his astoundingly brazen lie that there be no evidence for ricca homosexual activity in the first place we can take the assurance for what it seem to be worth next after another little inside nudge nudge wink wink joke about the gay lobby implying but of course never outright say that the whole thing be hysterical nonsense we hear direct contradiction to catholic teaching from no less source than his predecessor pope benedict ratzinger the problem be not have this tendency well actually your holiness yes it be particularly in the case of priest the tendency be call in the same catechism you quote intrinsically disorder and ratzinger be very clear that this tendency be sign of serious emotional dysfunction that must preclude man from be ordain squander the capital of trust few month ago in piece for the remnant talk about why the church and nearly all human society regard lie as sin mistake many make about lie be to understand it only in term of morality but thomas make the point that it be first matter of metaphysic lie be an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality thomistic theology teach that it be by lie that we become most like the devil and most unlike god because we be try to change the nature of reality to suit our own purpose habitual lie in effect change you into different kind of be one that be by nature an opponent of truth order against truth this of course mean that person whose orientation as we might say be towards falsehood even when he be at any give moment say something true be still service his lie he tell the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality it be not by violence but by lie and manipulation by issue half truth and pretend to be the kind of man he be not that shakespeare character iago earn the title of most evil character in english literature human being be naturally order towards the truth and we have to work at assume lie this be why confidence trickster can be successful why lie work for get what you want people don see it come the first natural assumption be trust at least at the basic level of expect truth most of the time we therefore instinctively see lie as betrayal of trust consider how much trust the catholic faithful have in the papacy until about 1965 how much un earn trust francis start with just by be elect this pontificate should be remember as one of the great confidence scam in history believe catholic have watch aghast as this pope have habitually trample on every aspect of

88,"in recent communication between randy credico an assange supporter comic and radio producer and adam schiff the rank member on the house judiciary committee assange fear of arrest and extradition to the us be confirm by the leader of the russia gate frenzy credico receive the follow response from schiff after meet the congressman staff in which credico be try to connect assange with schiff our committee would be willing to interview assange when he be in custody and not before dennis bernstein speak with john pilger close friend and supporter of assange on may 29 the interview begin with the statement bernstein deliver for pilger at the left forum last weekend in new york on panel devote to assange entitle russia gate and wikileak pilger statement there be silence among many who call themselves leave the silence be julian assange as every false accusation have fall away eevery bogus smear show to be the work of political enemy julian stand vindicate as one who have expose system that threaten humanity the collateral damage video the war log of afghanistan and iraq the cablegate revelation the venezuela revelation the podesta email revelation these be just few of the storm of raw truth that have blow through the capital of rapacious power tthe fakery in russia gate the collusion of corrupt medium and the attack of legal system that pursue truth teller have not be able to hold back the raw truth of wikileak revelation they have not win not yet and they have not destroy the man only the silence of good people will allow they to win julian assange have never be more isolated he need your support and your voice now soon than ever be the time to demand justice and free speech for julian thank you no place to hide edwa glenn greenwald good price 1. 49 buy new 3. 70 as of edt detail dennis bernstein we continue our discussion of the case of julian assange now in the ecuadorian embassy in great britain john pilger it be great to talk to you again but it be profound tragedy john the way they be treat julian assange this prolific journalist and publisher who so many other journalist have depend on in the past he have be totally leave out in the cold to fend for himself john pilger have never know anything like it there be kind of eerie silence around the julian assange case julian have be vindicate in every possible way and yet he be isolate as few people be these day he be cut off from the very tool of his trade visitor aren allow be in london recently and couldn see he although speak to people who have see he rafael correa the former president of ecuador say recently that he regard what they be do to julian now as torture it be correa government that give julian political refuge which have be betray now by his successor the government lead by lenin moreno which be back to sucking up to the united states in the time honor way with julian as the pawn and victim should be constitutional hero but really it come down to the british government although he be still in foreign embassy and actually have ecuadorian nationality his right of passage out of that embassy should be guarantee by the british government the united nations work party on unlawful detention have make that clear britain take part in an investigation which determine that julian be political refugee and that great miscarriage of justice have be impose on he it be very good that you be do this dennis because even in the medium outside the mainstream there be this silence about julian the street outside the embassy be virtually empty whereas they should be full of people say that we be with you the principle involve in this case be absolutely clear cut number one be justice the injustice do to this man be legion both in term of the bogus swedish case and now the fact that he must remain in the embassy and can leave without be arrest extradite to the united states and end up in hell hole but it be also about frfreedom of speech bout our right to know which be enshrine in the united states constitution if the constitution be take literally julian would be constitutional hero actually instead understand the indictment they be try to concoct read like charge of espionage it so ridiculous that be the situation as see it dennis it be not happy one but it be one that people should rally to quickly db his journalistic brother be sound like his prosecutor they want to get behind russia gate freak like congressman adam schiff and mike pompeo who would like to see assange in jail forever or even execute how do you respond to journalist act like prosecutor some of whom use his material to do story this be terrible time for journalism jp you be absolutely right it be terrible time for journalism have never know anything quite like it in my career that say it be not new there have always be so call mainstream which really come down to great power in medium it have always exist particularly in the united states the pulitzer prize this year be award to the new york times and the washington post for witch hunting around russia gate they be praise for how deeply source their investigation be their investigation turn up not shred of real evidence to suggest any serious russian intervention in the 2016 election like webb the julian assange case remind of the gary webb case bob parry be one of gary webb few supporter in the medium webb dark alliance series contain evidence that cocaine trafficking be go on with the connivance of the cia later webb be hound by fellow journalist and unable to find work he eventually commit suicide the cia inspector general subsequently vindicate he now julian assange be long way from take his own life his resilience be remarkable but he be still human being and he have take such battering probably the hard thing for he to take be the utter hypocrisy of news organization like the new york times which publish the wikileak war log and cablegate the washington post and the guardian which have take vindictive delight in torment julian the guardian few year ago get pulitzer prize write about snowden but their coverage of snowden leave he in hong kong it be wikileak that got snowden out of hong kong and to safety professionally find this one of the most unsavory and immoral thing have see in my career the persecution of this man by huge medium organization which have draw great benefit from wikileak one of assange great tormentor the guardian luke harding make great deal of money with hollywood version of book that he and david lee write in which they basically attack their source suppose you have to be psychiatrist to understand all of this my understanding be that so many of these journalist be shamed. hey realize that wikileak have do what they should have do long time ago and that be to tell we how government lie db one thing that disturb greatly be the way in which the western corporate press speculate about russian involvement in the 2016 election that it be hack through julian assange any serious investigator would want to know who would be motivate and yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so piss off people who go to work for the clinton machine and learn from the inside that the dnc be all about getting rid of bernie sander this be not part of the story eight hundred thousand disclosure on russia jp what happen to sander and the way that he be roll by the clinton organization everybody know that this be the story and now we have the dnc suing wikileak there kind of farcical element to this mean none of this come from the russians that wikileak be somehow in bed with the russians be ludicrous wikileak publish about 800, 000 major disclosure about russia some of they extremely critical of the russian government if you be government and you be do something untoward or you be lie to your people and wikileak get the document to show it they will publish no matter who you be be they the united states or russia db randy credico because of his work and his decision to devote very high profile series to the persecution of julian assange recently find himself under attack he go to the white house press roast and after have nice discussion with congressman schiff he yell out what about julian assange the room be pack full of reporter but randy be attack and drag out it be if everyone there be embarrassed to recognize that one of their brother be be brutalize jp randy shout some truth it be very similar to what happen to ray mcgovern ray be former member of the cia but extremely principled might suggest he be renegade now db it be hysterical to watch these four armed guard who keep shout stop resist stop resist and they be beat the hell out of he jp think the image of ray be haul off be particularly tell these four overweight obviously ill train young man manhandle ray who be 78 year old there be something highly emblematic about that for he stand up to challenge the fact that the cia be about to hand over leadership to person who have be in charge of torture it be both shocking and surreal which of course the julian assange case be as well but real journalism should be able to get through the shocking and the surreal and get to the truth there be so much collusion now with all these dark and menacing development it be almost as if the word journalism be becoming blight db there have certainly be lot of collusion when it come to israel then the word collusion be quite appropriate jp that the ultimate collusion but that collusion with silence never have there be collusion like the one between the and israel it suggest another word and that be immunity it have moral immunity cultural immunity geopolitical immunity legal immunity and certainly medium immunity we see the gunning down of over 60 people on the day of the inauguration of the new embassy in jerusalem israel have some of the most wickedly experimental munition in the world and they fire they at

be do in our name on our behalf or to our detriment be our moral right julian feel very passionately about this there be time when he could have compromise slightly in order to possibly help his situation there be time when say to he why don you just suspend that for while and go along with it of course know beforehand what his answer would be and that be no the enormous amount of information that have come from wikileak particularly in recent year have amount to an extraordinary public service be read just the other day 2006 wikileak cable from the embassy in caraca which be address to other agency in the region this be four year after the try to get rid of chavez in coup it detail how subversion should work of course they dress it up as human right work and so on be read this official document think how the information contain in it be worth year of the kind of distorted reporting from venezuela it also remind we that so call meddling by russia in the be just nonsense the word meddle doesn apply to the kind of action imply in this document it be intervention in another country affair wiwikileak have do that all over the world it have give people the information they have right to have they have right to find out from the so call war log the criminality of our war in afghanistan and iraq they have right to find out about cablegate at when on clinton watch we learn that the nsa be gather personal information on member of the united nations security council include their credit card number you can see why julian make enemy but he should also have make huge number of friend this be critical information because it tell we how power work and we will never learn about it otherwise think wikileak have open world of transparency and put flesh on the expression right to know this must explain why he be attack so much because that be so threaten the enemy to great power be not the like of the taliban it be we db and who can forget the release of the collateral murder footage by chelsea manning jp that kind of thing be not uncommon vietnam be mean to be the open war but really it wasn there weren the camera around it be indeed shocking information but it inform people and we have chelsea man courage to thank for that db yes and the thank he get be seven year in solitary confinement they want to prosecute assange and maybe hang he from the rafter in congress but what about judith miller and the new york times lie the west into war there be no end of horrific example of what pass for journalism in contrast to the amazing contribution that julian

89,"in recent communication between randy credico an assange supporter comic and radio producer and adam schiff current rank member on the house judiciary committee assange fear of arrest and extradition to the us be confirm by the leader of the russia gate frenzy credico receive the follow response from schiff after meet the congressman staff in which credico be try to connect assange with schiff our committee would be willing to interview assange when he be in custody and not before dennis bernstein speak with john pilger close friend and supporter of assange on may 29 the interview begin with the statement bernstein deliver for pilger at the left forum last weekend in new york on panel devote to assange entitle russia gate and wikileak pilger statement there be silence among many who call themselves leave the silence be julian assange as every false accusation have fall away eevery bogus smear show to be the work of political enemy julian stand vindicate as one who have expose system that threaten humanity the collateral damage video show war log of afghanistan and iraq the cablegate revelation the venezuela revelation the podesta email revelation these be just few of the storm of raw truth that have blow through the capital of rapacious power tthe fakery of russia gate the collusion of corrupt medium and the shame of legal system that pursue truth teller have not be able to hold back the raw truth of wikileak revelation they have not win not yet and they have not destroy the man only the silence of good people will allow they to win julian assange have never be more isolated he need your support and your voice now more than ever be the time to demand justice and free speech for julian thank you no place to hide edwa glenn greenwald good price 1. 49 buy new 3. 70 as of edt detail dennis bernstein we continue our discussion of the case of julian assange now in the ecuadorian embassy in great britain john pilger it be great to talk to you again but they be profound tragedy john the way they be treat julian assange this prolific journalist and publisher who so many other journalist have depend on in the past he have be totally leave out in the cold to fend for himself john pilger have never know anything like it there be kind of eerie silence around the julian assange case julian have be vindicate in every possible way and yet he be isolate as few people be these day he be cut off from the very tool of his trade visitor aren allow be in london recently and couldn see he although speak to people who have see he rafael correa the former president of ecuador say recently that he regard what they be do to julian now as torture it be correa government that give julian political refuge which have be betray now by his successor the government lead by lenin moreno which be back to sucking up to the united states in the time honor way with julian as the pawn and victim should be constitutional hero but really it come down to the british government although he be still in foreign embassy and actually have ecuadorian nationality his right of passage out of that embassy should be guarantee by the british government the united nations work party on unlawful detention have make that clear britain take part in an investigation which determine that julian be political refugee and that great miscarriage of justice have be impose on he it be very good that you be do this dennis because even in the medium outside the mainstream there be this silence about julian the street outside the embassy be virtually empty whereas they should be full of people say that we be with you the principle involve in this case be absolutely clear cut number one be justice the injustice do to this man be legion both in term of the bogus swedish case and now the fact that he must remain in the embassy and can leave without be arrest extradite to the united states and end up in hell hole but it be also about frfreedom of speech bout our right to know which be enshrine in the united states constitution if the constitution be take literally julian would be constitutional hero actually instead understand the indictment they be try to concoct read like charge of espionage it so ridiculous that be the situation as see it dennis it be not happy one but it be one that people should rally to quickly db his journalistic brother be sound like his prosecutor they want to get behind russia gate freak like congressman adam schiff and mike pompeo who would like to see assange in jail forever or even execute how do you respond to journalist act like prosecutor some of whom use his material to do story this be terrible time for journalism jp you be absolutely right it be terrible time for journalism have never know anything quite like it in my career that say it be not new there have always be so call mainstream which really come down to great power in medium it have always exist particularly in the united states the pulitzer prize this year be award to the new york times and the washington post for witch hunting around russia gate they be praise for how deeply source their investigation be their investigation turn up not shred of real evidence to suggest any serious russian intervention in the 2016 election like webb the julian assange case remind of the gary webb case bob parry be one of gary webb few supporter in the medium webb dark alliance series contain evidence that cocaine trafficking be go on with the connivance of the cia later webb be hound by fellow journalist and unable to find work he eventually commit suicide the cia inspector general subsequently vindicate he now julian assange be long way from take his own life his resilience be remarkable but he be still human being and he have take such battering probably the hard thing for he to take be the utter hypocrisy of news organization like the new york times which publish the wikileak war log and cablegate the washington post and the guardian which have take vindictive delight in torment julian the guardian few year ago get pulitzer prize write about snowden but their coverage of snowden leave he in hong kong it be wikileak that got snowden out of hong kong and to safety professionally find this one of the most unsavory and immoral thing have see in my career the persecution of this man by huge medium organization which have draw great benefit from wikileak one of assange great tormentor the guardian luke harding make great deal of money with hollywood version of book that he and david lee write in which they basically attack their source suppose you have to be psychiatrist to understand all of this my understanding be that so many of these journalist be shamed. hey realize that wikileak have do what they should have do long time ago and that be to tell we how government lie db one thing that disturb greatly be the way in which the western corporate press speculate about russian involvement in the 2016 election that it be hack through julian assange any serious investigator would want to know who would be motivate and yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so piss off people who go to work for the clinton machine and learn from the inside that the dnc be all about getting rid of bernie sander this be not part of the story eight hundred thousand disclosure on russia jp what happen to sander and the way that he be roll by the clinton organization everybody know that this be the story and now we have the dnc suing wikileak there kind of farcical element to this mean none of this come from the russians that wikileak be somehow in bed with the russians be ludicrous wikileak publish about 800, 000 major disclosure about russia some of they extremely critical of the russian government if you be government and you be do something untoward or you be lie to your people and wikileak get the document to show it they will publish no matter who you be be they the united states or russia db randy credico because of his work and his decision to devote very high profile series to the persecution of julian assange recently find himself under attack he go to the white house press roast and after have nice discussion with congressman schiff he yell out what about julian assange the room be pack full of reporter but randy be attack and drag out it be if everyone there be embarrassed to recognize that one of their brother be be brutalize jp randy shout some truth it be very similar to what happen to ray mcgovern ray be former member of the cia but extremely principled might suggest he be renegade now db it be hysterical to watch these four armed guard who keep shout stop resist stop resist and they be beat the hell out of he jp think the image of ray be haul off be particularly tell these four overweight obviously ill train young man manhandle ray who be 78 year old there be something highly emblematic about that for he stand up to challenge the fact that the cia be about to hand over leadership to person who have be in charge of torture it be both shocking and surreal which of course the julian assange case be as well but real journalism should be able to get through the shocking and the surreal and get to the truth there be so much collusion now with all these dark and menacing development it be almost as if the word journalism be becoming blight db there have certainly be lot of collusion when it come to israel then the word collusion be quite appropriate jp that the ultimate collusion but that collusion with silence never have there be

102,it no secret that the trump administration have strong distaste for iran iran be one of the only issue on which the president have remain relatively consistent trump berate the country both before and after take office however trump anti iran strategy go against the well judgment of even the most anti iranian advisor in his staff who don want to see the isolate on the world stage fortunately for trump however he be not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize iran at all cost on december 12 trump ambassador to the nikki haley give grandiose speech demonize iran that echo colin powell infamous performance before the in 2003 haley essential claim be that saudi arabia be under attack by missile supply to yemen by the iranian government and that the government should not sit idly by as this go on if we do nothing about the missile fire at saudi arabia we will not be able to stop the violence haley warn there be clear evidence that the missile that land on saudi arabia come from iran she say the evidence be undeniable the weapon might as well have have make in iran sticker all over it buy gold at discount price however even as haley open her mouth many commentator could already identify number of issue with her speech as common dream reza marashi explain haley cite un report in her claim regard iranian missile transfer to the houthis of course the un have reach no such conclusion instead panel of expert conclude that fire missile fragment show component from an iranian company but they have no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier ask about herself claim that iran be the culprit sweden ambassador to the un say the info have be less clear analyst from the department of defense speak to reporter at haley speech openly acknowledge that they do not know the missile origin perhaps most surreal be the very same un report cite by haley also say the missile include component that be manufacture by an american company do she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remark or fail to read the entire un report the world may never know regardless of the fact that haley misrepresent the report in question it appear the entire version of the report be almost completely incorrect anyway accord to former inspector scott ritter ritter write the missile debris in question actually contradict the finding of the un panel which hold that the missile launch against saudi arabia have be transfer to yemen in piece and assemble there by houthi missile engineer it be clear that the missile in question have be in the possession of yemen well before the saudi arabian lead intervention of 2015 and that their source be either soviet or north korean the modification kit on the other hand appear to be of iranian origin and be transport to yemen via oman the un panel claim not to have any evidence of external missile specialist work alongside the houthi indeed the simplicity of the burkhan modification concept be such that anyone already familiar with the scud missile system would be able to implement the require process without outside assistance emphasis add so where do the missile come from and who make they accord to ritter rather than the iranian manufacture qiam missile haley and the saudi arabian government claim the debris present by haley be of modify soviet manufacture scud missile the airframe and engine be original soviet make component and many of the small part on display bear cyrillic russian marking the transformation to the burkhan design require the houthi engineer to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tank and lengthen the airframe accordingly this be do by cut the airframe and welding in place the appropriate segment this also require that the fuel supply pipe which pass through the oxidizer tank be similarly lengthen the difference in quality between the factory weld and the new weld be readily discernable the increase fuel supply permit long engine burn which in turn increase the range of the missile the burkhan use small warhead than the scud as such the guidance and control section have be reconfigure to small diameter and an inter stage section add to connect the warhead guidance section with the main airframe those who have be pay attention to this conflict have be well aware that the have have little material evidence to link yemen houthis to iranian arm supplier in january of this year panel of expert state the panel have not see sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large scale supply of arm from the government of the islamic republic of iran although there be indicator that anti tank guide weapon be supply to the houthi or saleh force be of iranian manufacture emphasis add even if iran be arm the houthis haley hypocritical anti iran rhetoric doesn excuse the for continue foreign policy that essentially armed isis through weapon transfer or for arm al qaeda affiliate in syria just to name two example of washington schizophrenic approach to the region why be the single out iran especially when the houthi rebel be swear enemy of al qaeda the issue here go much deep than nonsensical hypocrisy accord to ritter the entire debacle have show that if saudi arabia can not contain the houthi missile capability it can not possibly hope to take on iran which possess significantly more advanced military than the houthis do on their own ritter explain far if relatively unsophisticated foe such as the houthi use iranian modify soviet and north korean missile derive from 40 year old technology can evade an enemy force use the most modern combat aircraft back up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering system available and successfully launch ballistic missile that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state what do that say about the prospect of any lead coalition take on the far more advanced mobile missile threat that exist in north korea and iran today the fact of the matter be that no military anywhere have show the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way determined opponent arm with mobile ballistic missile capability if the saudi experience in yemen be to teach we anything it be that any military plan design to confront nation such as north korea iran and russia that be arm with sophisticated mobile ballistic missile have well count on those capability remain intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility no amount of chest thumping and empty rhetoric by american political and or military leader can offset this harsh reality this be the

on formation through course also on communion between the community there be meeting of the council with the community we be ready to accept sister who can not be care for in their own community however this have not be accept because they do not want to be separate the strange report come from the netherlands where for single survive autonomous monastery and an average age of 81 resource be mobilise to create completely new structure complete with approval from the congregation for religious federation netherland date when erect 1971 number of convent number of nun 73 solemnly profess 73 in formation average age 81 nb the bold be in the original what have be do 13 dutch carmel and one in iceland have unite in federation this have create close communion from the beginning everyone have collaborate in the process of amalgamation and suppression present problem only one carmel function fully autonomously in the netherlands community be in care home run by the brother of the immaculate conception another carmel be renew in 1990 at the original carmel an infirmary wing have be add for those sister who require nursing it be run by franciscan sister with the passing of time the assembly of the federation have transfer task to the president of the federation accord to the faculty describe in the statute in particular regard our mutual solidarity also with the passing of the year the congregation for religious have place responsibility directly into the hand of the council of the federation finally the autonomous carmel have ask help from the federation in order to protect their interest due to our very advanced age in the netherland we have reach the moment when general assembly be no long possible we be leave with the problem that in the community there be no sister who can or who want to be prioress or council sister the structure of the federation that we have have till now be thus no long possible possible solution the federation council the religious assistant together with canon lawyer of the dutch conference of religious have work hard on completely new structure in which in its first draft the autonomy of the carmel have be constantly keep in mind we begin from three point maintenance of the formal autonomy of the carmel that still exist but with the chance to transfer task gradually to the council of the federation appointment of the federal board or federal council of the federation preferably appoint by the superior general the team will consist of president and vice president who be member of one of the convent appoint to function and of three people who be member or not of one of the convent supervisory council also to be appoint periodically by the superior general which will be make up of three member whose president will be preferably member of religious institute preferably of the carmelite order and appoint to function this council see itself as supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the assembly of the federation in october 2008 the president the religious assistant and lawyer be in rome where they explain the proposal they have meeting with fr general and with the congregation for religious these be open meeting that help we to clarify matter an important concern be that they would allow we to use lay people on the federal council of the federation and the supervisory council we be aware that we be not deal with simple matter but we think that in view of our present situation today we do not have much choice it be important to continue to protect the interest of our federation in the most responsible and careful way so that all the sister even those advanced in year can continue to live their life in carmel definitive permission come at the 25th of february give this incredible picture of carmelite order in the last rattle of its death throe the rest of the summary of speech give at the meeting in avila read as outright surreal leave we to wonder if any of these people be attach in any way to reality sr enrica rosanna the representative of the vatican congregation for religious tell they that the two great challenge to our contemplative life be the challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy she warn the nun against bring vocation from other country to keep their monastery alive drop hint about what now seem to be particular obsession of the congregation cor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018 the nun be exhort to stay awake to welcome the dawn of bright new future these be difficult and uncertain time but it be also the time to stay awake as the new dawn be already announce itself our aim must be to be open to the future we should not forget that we be follow in the tradition of teresa of jesus and in the tradition of all those who have follow in her footstep it be wide road that open up before we we must be woman of hope and faith we must always believe that god be the one who direct history from this derive our task to be creative and at the same time faithful creative fidelity emphasis in the original while there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the carmelite order in western europe be foremost in the mind of the nun present it seem that the issue be simply not address out loud by the representative of the bureaucracy instead sr enrica after this bizarre and cryptic comment speak of the problem and difficulty that we can encounter in discernment of mostly non existent vocation include consumerism modern mean of communication difficulty in create stable personality autonomy of the young the need to be always support the ideology of subjectivism what be these people smoke give that this be three year or more from the abdication of benedict and the installation of the new paradigm of francis kasper one wonder what this new dawn be actually about perhaps useful question for one of the nun present could have be new dawn of what exactly this kind of code language have be popular with the progressivist faction in the church since the 1960 when the expectation be for the installation of totally new church be sr enrica somehow anticipate the fulfillment of those hippie era dream in the year to come it be certainly clear from francis first act as pope that he have deal with conservative and traditionalist nun high on his list of priority his first appointment no more than three week after the conclave be jose rodrigue carballo the religious congregation secretary and give the scandal that erupt on his leave they the financial wreck ball of the franciscan friar minor the first task francis give carballo be the demolition of the franciscan friar of the immaculate certainly this record of the european carmelite meeting be jammed with hint that cor orans be on the way on the final day of the meeting the theme for the day be offer by then father general luis arostegui government the need for change autonomy and association autonomy and fr general other solution to government the devolution of authority of superior of individual monastery to federation be obviously on someone mind as be plan to see to it that monastery change superior frequently essential autonomy can fail due to the relationship within the community abuse by permanent superior who decide on the freedom and decision of the community the father general warn and there be certainly hint that general re organisation of structure of authority be in the work common tactic of politician who want to initiate change be to ask question rather than make suggestion and arostegui ask some very leading question indeed in this closing address who discern the existence or not of vital autonomy be it the community or choose people be there instance that work well within the church which balance autonomy in way that can be helpful in these situation at the time of st teresa she be an example of someone balanced stability be one reason for autonomy but be stability understand in such way that it can obstruct the spirit of mission and your availability to the order and to the church the valiant and prophetic initiative of pope pius xii to create association and federation open up contemplative life though it be also think that it could harm cloister and autonomy can such essential autonomy continue as it be 50 year ago there be stability how do we conceive today the relationship between autonomy and federation association and between autonomy and fr general could there be other form of government follow the father general address be note from the language group include the following while some community do not want their autonomy to be touch and have certain fear of external interference other want more moderate and flexible autonomy that without go to the congregation would have juridical form where the president with her council can intervene in extreme case that today we watch with pain our hand tie though we want these legal channel to be establish it must remain clear what the limit of the federation council be in order to avoid abuse of power on the part of the same the absence of vital autonomy be also notice when the same person remain prioress for year we need criterion that expand number 203 of our constitution and clarify vital autonomy we perceive that there be shortage of authority figure we do not want new figure but rather those that already exist association federation president provincial be empower in legal way canonically to help community in difficulty for the mission to discern to counsel to accompany we be also concerned for those community not affiliate to federation we see that we should be close to they maybe this summary document of 2009 can give we an idea what to expect from rome in 2018 now that the progressivist faction in the vatican be in the ascendancy and be free to act without restriction what come clear compare this document to cor orans be that the vatican machinery have long be at work force uniform and essentially bureaucratic heavily authoritarian and legalistic vision of contemplative life on anyone who fail sufficiently to resist it and with the statistic offer at this meeting we can see clearly where this road lead so many catholic in the last 40 year assume that under the conservatives john paul ii and benedict xvi at least the vatican be onside at least in rome they understand the terrible threat of the bolshie vaticantwoist revolutionary but this report of 2009 show clear picture of roman congregation determined to see the revolution through to its inevitable conclusion an aside that will perhaps be noteworthy to traditionalist reader be the little comment in the report on the difficulty of have liturgical observance between all the disparate nation represent at the meeting eucharist and laud in spanish fr isidore silva have prepare booklet with the liturgy for each day each psalm be in different language and be prepare by the corresponding liturgical group however have the text in front of we make it easy to follow the recitation in other language the end result be that we could all join in the liturgy we be all unite in the praise of the spirit who have bring we there together from different language and nation solution new foundation the spreading of the carmelite charism into new territory this include all sister up to final profession not just postulant and novicedismal record why be they destroy the nun",1

to maintain all presence possible solution it be completely necessary to assume the way of the restructuring in order to live what be essential forget the number the challenge to grow in confidence and communion should lead we to downgrade the famous and untouchable autonomy because to daughter of saint teresa the really important thing be to look for he and to live in obedience another of our challenge be care for the ecclesial presence we think this be the way will lead we to recreate from the interior the charism of the mother teresa federation france toulouse bordeaux date when erect

also on communion between the community there be meeting of the council with the community we be ready to accept sister who can not be care for in their own community however this have not be accept because they do not want to be separate the strange report come from the netherlands where for single survive autonomous monastery and an average age of 81 resource be mobilise to create completely new structure complete with approval from the congregation for religious federation netherland date when erect 1971 number of convent number of nun 73 solemnly profess 73 in formation average age 81 nb the bold be in the original what have be do 13 dutch carmel and one in iceland have unite in federation this have create close communion from the beginning everyone have collaborate in the process of amalgamation and suppression present problem only one carmel function fully autonomously in the netherlands community be in care home run by the brother of the immaculate conception another carmel be renew in 1990 at the original carmel an infirmary wing have be add for those sister who require nursing it be run by franciscan sister with the passing of time the assembly of the federation have transfer task to the president of the federation accord to the faculty describe in the statute in particular regard our mutual solidarity also with the passing of the year the congregation for religious have place responsibility directly into the hand of the council of the federation finally the autonomous carmel have ask help from the federation in order to protect their interest due to our very advanced age in the netherland we have reach the moment when general assembly be no long possible we be leave with the problem that in the community there be no sister who can or who want to be prioress or council sister the structure of the federation that we have have till now be thus no long possible possible solution the federation council the religious assistant together with canon lawyer of the dutch conference of religious have work hard on completely new structure in which in its first draft the autonomy of the carmel have be constantly keep in mind we begin from three point maintenance of the formal autonomy of the carmel that still exist but with the chance to transfer task gradually to the council of the federation appointment of the federal board or federal council of the federation preferably appoint by the superior general the team will consist of president and vice president who be member of one of the convent appoint to function and of three people who be member or not of one of the convent supervisory council also to be appoint periodically by the superior general which will be make up of three member whose president will be preferably member of religious institute preferably of the carmelite order and appoint to function this council see itself as supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the assembly of the federation in october 2008 the president the religious assistant and lawyer be in rome where they explain the proposal they have meeting with fr general and with the congregation for religious these be open meeting that help we to clarify matter an important concern be that they would allow we to use lay people on the federal council of the federation and the supervisory council we be aware that we be not deal with simple matter but we think that in view of our present situation today we do not have much choice it be important to continue to protect the interest of our federation in the most responsible and careful way so that all the sister even those advanced in year can continue to live their life in carmel definitive permission come at the 25th of february give this incredible picture of carmelite order in the last rattle of its death throe the rest of the summary of speech give at the meeting in avila read as outright surreal leave we to wonder if any of these people be attach in any way to reality sr enrica rosanna the representative of the vatican congregation for religious tell they that the two great challenge to our contemplative life be the challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy she warn the nun against bring vocation from other country to keep their monastery alive drop hint about what now seem to be particular obsession of the congregation cor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018 the nun be exhort to stay awake to welcome the dawn of bright new future these be difficult and uncertain time but it be also the time to stay awake as the new dawn be already announce itself our aim must be to be open to the future we should not forget that we be follow in the tradition of teresa of jesus and in the tradition of all those who have follow in her footstep it be wide road that open up before we we must be woman of hope and faith we must always believe that god be the one who direct history from this derive our task to be creative and at the same time faithful creative fidelity emphasis in the original while there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the carmelite order in western europe be foremost in the mind of the nun present it seem that the issue be simply not address out loud by the representative of the bureaucracy instead sr enrica after this bizarre and cryptic comment speak of the problem and difficulty that we can encounter in discernment of mostly non existent vocation include consumerism modern mean of communication difficulty in create stable personality autonomy of the young the need to be always support the ideology of subjectivism what be these people smoke give that this be three year or more from the abdication of benedict and the installation of the new paradigm of francis kasper one wonder what this new dawn be actually about perhaps useful question for one of the nun present could have be new dawn of what exactly this kind of code language have be popular with the progressivist faction in the church since the 1960 when the expectation be for the installation of totally new church be sr enrica somehow anticipate the fulfillment of those hippie era dream in the year to come it be certainly clear from francis first act as pope that he have deal with conservative and traditionalist nun high on his list of priority his first appointment no more than three week after the conclave be jose rodrigue carballo the religious congregation secretary and give the scandal that erupt on his leave they the financial wreck ball of the franciscan friar minor the first task francis give carballo be the demolition of the franciscan friar of the immaculate certainly this record of the european carmelite meeting be jammed with hint that cor orans be on the way on the final day of the meeting the theme for the day be offer by then father general luis arostegui government the need for change autonomy and association autonomy and fr general other solution to government the devolution of authority of superior of individual monastery to federation be obviously on someone mind as be plan to see to it that monastery change superior frequently essential autonomy can fail due to the relationship within the community abuse by permanent superior who decide on the freedom and decision of the community the father general warn and there be certainly hint that general re organisation of structure of authority be in the work common tactic of politician who want to initiate change be to ask question rather than make suggestion and arostegui ask some very leading question indeed in this closing address who discern the existence or not of vital autonomy be it the community or choose people be there instance that work well within the church which balance autonomy in way that can be helpful in these situation at the time of st teresa she be an example of someone balanced stability be one reason for autonomy but be stability understand in such way that it can obstruct the spirit of mission and your availability to the order and to the church the valiant and prophetic initiative of pope pius xii to create association and federation open up contemplative life though it be also think that it could harm cloister and autonomy can such essential autonomy continue as it be 50 year ago there be stability how do we conceive today the relationship between autonomy and federation association and between autonomy and fr general could there be other form of government follow the father general address be note from the language group include the following while some community do not want their autonomy to be touch and have certain fear of external interference other want more moderate and flexible autonomy that without go to the congregation would have juridical form where the president with her council can intervene in extreme case that today we watch with pain our hand tie though we want these legal channel to be establish it must remain clear what the limit of the federation council be in order to avoid abuse of power on the part of the same the absence of vital autonomy be also notice when the same person remain prioress for year we need criterion that expand number 203 of our constitution and clarify vital autonomy we perceive that there be shortage of authority figure we do not want new figure but rather those that already exist association federation president provincial be empower in legal way canonically to help community in difficulty for the mission to discern to counsel to accompany we be also concerned for those community not affiliate to federation we see that we should be close to they maybe this summary document of 2009 can give we an idea what to expect from rome in 2018 now that the progressivist faction in the vatican be in the ascendancy and be free to act without restriction what come clear compare this document to cor orans be that the vatican machinery have long be at work force uniform and essentially bureaucratic heavily authoritarian and legalistic vision of contemplative life on anyone who fail sufficiently to resist it and with the statistic offer at this meeting we can see clearly where this road lead so many catholic in the last 40 year assume that under the conservatives john paul ii and benedict xvi at least the vatican be onside at least in rome they understand the terrible threat of the bolshie vaticantwoist revolutionary but this report of 2009 show clear picture of roman congregation determined to see the revolution through to its inevitable conclusion an aside that will perhaps be noteworthy to traditionalist reader be the little comment in the report on the difficulty of have liturgical observance between all the disparate nation represent at the meeting eucharist and laud in spanish fr isidore silva have prepare booklet with the liturgy for each day each psalm be in different language and be prepare by the corresponding liturgical group however have the text in front of we make it easy to follow the recitation in other language the end result be that we could all join in the liturgy we be all unite in the praise of the spirit who have bring we there together from different language and nation solution new foundation the spreading of the carmelite charism into new territory this include all sister up to final profession not just postulant and novicedismal record why be they destroy the nun",1

can see by their url but of course since they too push political message for profit waaah trump as do all the other corporate medium outlet out there they change their headline to facebook purge over 800 account and page for push political spam the fact that many of these account be also suspend by twitter shortly thereafter should tell you that this be coordinated effort to silence large swath of the population of course the good coverage of this be from russia sputnik news contact many of the alternative journalist who be purge to get their take on what happen you may recall that basically every blogger outside the establishment medium be accuse of be secretly russian during the 2016 election by the washington post so perhaps actual russians have vested interest in the truth come out on this topic my friend john vibe be an amazing person who contribute to the free thought project he say this signify re consolidation of the medium cable news medium control the narrative for most of modern history but the internet have lower that barrier to entry and allow the average person to become the medium themselves this obviously take market share and influence away from the traditional medium and it have allow for more diverse public conversation now it seem the platform that have monopolize the industry be favor mainstream source and silence alternative voice so now instead of allow more people to have voice these platform be create an atmosphere where only powerful medium organization be welcome just as we have on cable news people think that we be just provide an activist spin on the news but they don see the family struggle to have their voice hear for example when someone be shoot by police mainstream medium source often just republish the press release from the police department without present the victim side of the story we give the victim and their family voice which be essential to keep power in check this also go for big issue like foreign policy as well multiple full scale invasion of syria have be prevent because of information that the alternative medium make viral source nicholas bernabe of the antimedia be another alternative journalist consider friend and support wholeheartedly he work tirelessly to be voice of truth in world of lie he tell sputnik our approach generally be to cover story and angle that corporate medium underreport or misreport and to amplify activist and anti war voice and story all of our content be professionally fact check and edit get into this line of work because feel there be need for medium that challenge mainstream assumption and bias in politic want to shed light on corruption and wrongdoing against oppressed people and cover the harsh truth about american foreign policy over the last 28 day we reach 7, 088 000 people on facebook the timing of this purge be rather dubious in my view come shortly before the midterm election this could be an attempt by facebook itself to affect the outcome of the come election the twitter suspension catch by surprise can only speculate that these suspension be coordinated effort to stifle our message ahead of the come election source remember this be coordinate across multiple platform remember when this happen to alex jones back in september an assault be lead by youtube google and facebook against alex jones of infowar fame all of his account be shut down in quick succession follow by his credit card processing company and his newsletter service provider write at the time alex jones be just the beginning of this purge it go to get much bad meanwhile other dissent voice be be silence on social medium with limited reach and shadow ban infowar be massive profit machine but what happen when similar attack be launch on small alternative medium outlet it hit we right in the wallet and if they re hit hard enough they ll cease to be able to function jones have lot of money so this may not be the end of he but for most website owner this would be the absolute end of our ability to do business and to be able to bring the information we bring we do have to run our website as business it far more expensive than most people realize to run site know that my own operating cost every month be more than 2000 site as big as jones would be many time that amount when all your avenue of monetization be cut off it wouldn be hard for site and the dissent and information they share to cease to exist source this be not just about facebook or twitter it about the ability to find dissent information period google be in on

position rather than make straightforward case for why pope francis have change the church for the well faggioli reject the possibility of evaluate his papacy in term of continuity with past pope since do so would assume that christianity at some point be complete which faggioli do not think be true if emphatically disagree with this argument have to hand it to faggioli from the outset he make clear that he be not plan to debate douthat on the implication of the francis papacy instead through combination of rhetorical trick and soft peddle hegelianism he would completely redefine the role and nature of the catholic church during the crux of the debate the discussion of communion for the divorced and remarried faggioli raise his most theologically unsettling point to defend his position that remarry person should be able to receive communion faggioli invoke the case of germany where 50 percent of catholic marriage end in divorce for faggioli the implication be that at least 50 percent of german catholic child never see their parent receive communion and lose their faith because of it this he say be bad for evangelization and in order to keep the pew full the church role should not be to deny communion to the divorced and remarried but instead to ask what would the catholic church do to make the faithful able to receive sacrament advertisement this be lovely suggestion and one that not entirely unsympathetic to however the fact remain that faggioli be suggest the church do much more than provide sacrament to the faithful just before invoke the german case faggioli characterize the country as one of the most secular in the world but rather than lame ##nt what secularism have work on marital life in germany reassert the church position on marriage and

word man be use god and in reality even if it be not outwardly discernible he be place himself above god to fully drive the point home benedict equate this kind of worship with the israelites desert worship of the bull calf unsurprisingly this progressive interpretation of catholic doctrine eventually reveal itself to be rank historicism throughout the debate faggioli draw out the argument that allow the remarried to receive communion would not represent radical change in doctrine but return to the teaching of the gospel eventually douthat draw his argument to its logical conclusion with this question be priest throughout history in fact mislead their divorce and remarry parishioner by tell they they could not receive communion after few second pause faggioli give the only answer he

that the tyrant king george commit against our forefather and what it be that our forefather would not put up with our american history find in that document teach that our forefather throw off the tyrant that would not be rule by god and declare resistance to tyrant be loyalty to god furthermore the motto of the american revolution be no king but king jesus america original national seal be rebellion to tyrant be obedience to god with picture on the inside of the seal show the pharaoh be overthrow by the sea with moses and the child of israel safe on the shore john hancock the first signer of the declaration of independence say resistance to tyranny become the christian duty of each individual continue steadfast and with proper sense of your dependence on god nobly defend those

first of all the authority give to our representative government be derive from we the people we receive our right from god and in turn delegate power to those who serve we the people representative work for we we do not work for they they be endow by their creator with certain unalienable right government be institute among man derive their power from the consent of the govern the declaration of independence he then quote roman 13 let every soul be subject unto the high power for there be no power but of god the power that be be ordain of god whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation for ruler be not terror to good work but to the evil wilt thou then not be afraid of the power do that which be good and thou shalt have praise of the same for he be the minister of god to thee for good but if thou do that which be evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he be the minister of god revenger to execute wrath upon he that doeth evil wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake for for this cause pay ye tribute also for they be god's minister attend continually upon this very thing render therefore to all their due tribute to whom tribute be due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour the first scripture say let every

church to submit to that which he condemn deuteronomy proverb absolutely not be the church to transgress his law or to magnify and enforce his law unto judgment psalm roman of course not if he do that would make god unjust jesus say think not that be come to destroy the law or the prophet be not come to destroy but to fulfil matthew the lord have in fact command nowhere in scripture for the church to submit to the wicked the bible teach just the exact opposite we be to have no fellowship with the unfruitful work of darkness but rather reprove expose they ephesian furthermore it would contradict what scripture teach we from genesis all the way to revelation every step of the way think of this those that serve we the people before take office swear to uphold the us constitution with their hand on the holy bible they be appoint to magnify law against crime not crime against the law psalm america be base on common law the mosaic institution read the book of moses no enactment of man can be consider law unless it conform to the law of god william blackstone english common law representative be to magnify the law not tear it down and yet this be what the biblically illiterate be teach

command of the gospel but an offering that god be ask amid the mass of impediment even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model what might be this generous response pope francis do not give an example in al 303 because he speak in general term of the dynamic of conscience moreover he know that concrete case vary widely in our sept 26 article in la stampa dr goldstein and provide hypothetical example of couple in purely civil marriage recognize that god be call they to live in continence we choose this example deliberately to demonstrate that the generous response could be the ending of particular sin our example be an attempt to show that professor brugger and seifert be wrong to believe al 303 imply that god be ask some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state it really just the opposite al 303 teach that conscience will come to recognize that god be ask for step in the right direction away from sin pope francis explain this again in al 305 when he say small step in the midst of great human limitation can be more pleasing to god than life which appear outwardly in order but move through the day without confront great difficulty in recent interview the italian philosopher rocco buttiglione provide this example for al 303 imagine father who have sick son and the child improve he still have fever but have stop vomit the child manage to keep in his stomach what he eat and have start therapy that seem to work the father be happy be he happy about the fact that the child be sick no he be pleased that his son give symptom of improvement and healing this be what pope francis be say in al 303 god be not happy with situation that be objectively at variance with the command of the gospel god however be happy when people in such situation

chris ferrara to robert fastiggi hour ago certainly agree that the latin text be the normative text even if it come later certainly do not agree that the latin text eliminate the grave problem with

the moral norm be not adhere to be sophistical what constitute move away from sin if not cease to commit the sin no example be provide in al because none can be the notion be nonsensical just how nonsensical be demonstrate by dr fastiggi claim that by move away from sin in the case of divorced and remarried couple francis mean their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of child but that would be cease to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandon the pretense that they be marry along with the illicit sexual relation itself such couple could always be absolve and receive holy communion under the church constant practice albeit privately to avoid scandal at any rate the brother and sister approach to the situation which be that of

publish in the national catholic register in fact the statement of the argentine bishop only speak of the possibility of access to the sacrament of reconciliation and the eucharist this could

amoris laetitia by cardinal schoenborn give in april 2016 when the exhortation be make public have read the cardinal's exposition in both italian and english and only find mention of the help of the sacrament in certain case once again mr ferrara assume this mean access to holy communion without prior sacramental confession with regard to the letter thank the bishop of malta it should be note that edward pentin mention letter of cardinal baldiserri not letter of pope francis moreover this letter have not be make public so we do not know exactly what it say other than an expression of thank this seem to be very thin evidence for claim pope francis wish the bishop to admit public adulterer to the sacrament while continue in their adulterous relation as lawyer ferrara should have well sense of what really count as evidence as christian he should also be mindful of the command against bear false witness beyond these consideration wish to express personal concern have about mr ferrara's standing in the catholic church he say that dr goldstein and be foot soldier of leviathan church because we defend the roman pontiff do mr ferrara believe that the catholic church under pope

subject to he this though be the very definition of schism find in the catechism of the catholic church 2089 and the 1983 cic canon 751 hope mr ferrara can clarify what he mean by the leviathan church under pope francis more simple question to he would be this be you refuse submission to the roman pontiff or communion with the member subject to he apologize ahead of time if misconstrue his word

254,to say that the news be messy today would be the height of an understatement every day newspaper headline present we with new set of conflict datum that convince we of lie that serve someone's interest no matter how hard we try to keep up with the situation weed out the redundant stuff to find the useful information amid the din be full time job sometimes though it be good to take few step back get back to the basic and remember who the player be what they want and then ask each of they the big question do they succeed but in order to be able to ask this question we must honestly ask ourselves the follow question what will they be willing to do to survive in the current circumstance this be the most uncomfortable question you can ask someone what would you do to survive to protect your family your position the idea you have of yourself everyone have limit to their morality everyone everyone have shadow dark side place where they withdraw into their hobbesian self and see the world only in term of war of all against all anyone who refuse to admit it be someone you should scream away from those who always claim moral superiority who be always the good one be those who have no limit to their behavior as the great mencken proclaim almost 70 year ago the urge to save humanity be almost always pretense the real urge be to lead power be what all messiah really seek not the ability to serve this be true even for godly brother who take the gospel to foreign land it be in this context that we must ask this question what will they do of course the answer be anything they need this be why never discard anything in my analysis that be why always ready to skip five or six step before the big move because that be the limit of the behavior of the group study today it may be davo tomorrow the fed the next day so they all have preferred end state solution to their personal equation with their own combination of input variable see it as set of differential equation to solve for all do they to boil down to set of outcome that will get someone close to their preferred outcome and the scary part for all of we should be realize that not only be there not single combination where everyone's outcome be maximize there be not even win lose condition there be only loser we because the first rule of any organization be self survival throw mission statement corporate speech and hr virtue signal in the dumpster and set it on fire at the end of the day all that matter be survival only when this be nearly assure can an organization begin to think beyond its rep ##tilian brain like you and and at this point all the major faction have be reduce to this their horizon be just out of reach and they be strive to reach it because it be there ready but like zeno's paradox they never reach it because it be never possible to reach it in the first place what fear more than anything what see in too many people who analyze the relationship between geopolitic market and ideology be complacency there be surprising amount of normalcy bias in the analyst caste too many calm head will prevail and not enough they all have plan until they get punch in the face so when you think of davos and their state goal for the great reset and rescue the world from climate change do you really think there be limit to their behavior do you really believe that they will not start nuclear war that they will not unleash virulent plague that they will not create cure bad than the disease that they will not cause false flag shooting in school or that they will not release supreme court opinion when you think of the federal reserve in the context of an unprecedented assault on its autonomy and the commercial banking interest whose protection be its raison d'etre do you really think that today at this point would not it cause an economic collapse to save itself from another group say davos that would threaten all of this with destruction so all those who pontificate on the fait that the fed will only make one or two rate hike because that be what the model be say because that be what the fed's past behavior be suppose to tell they what will you tell your customer when the fed make fourth hike of 50 basis point or that it will accelerate the pace of quantitative tightening to 125 billion month and allow the us 10 year bond to hit 10 be you go to shrug your shoulder and say um sorry it be my fault face with the prospect of nuclear rearm ukraine ally with neoconservative ideologue in congress and the us state department commit to singular vision of hegemony over the planet would it not be possible that russia be wage vicious war of attrition use the artillery tactic of world war ii to smash its adversary while ominously pledge to

we can barely follow the detail even surface would not they do anything to prevent their evil from come to light and be plausibly debunk know that denial be the only thing that matter in today newly confirm fomc chairman jerome powell be summon by president biden to the white house to discuss the economy biden and the democrats be scared to death this fall biden obviously want powell to stop raise rate democrat only want to lose 40 house seat in november that be all the election fraud infrastructure be pay for with george soros money powell have barely start the tightening cycle and these people shamelessly after delay his confirmation for year after abuse their power over the fed summon powell like dog to the white house and tell he do not hurt our chance this fall if be powell would smile like the cheshire cat before disappear into the bowel of the marriner eccle building and consider 75 basis point hike just for fun or he might see his shadow get scared and make deal but at this point with whom with whom do we make an agreement bondholder davo biden with whom seriously be this what our politic be reduce to by these venal moron control by davos be there still people out there who be think bit it be be year since ve be tell you that no one be ask the right question about what the fed be prepared to do not just to save itself but possibly with the much large goal of break people who intentionally break the world for their benefit too many people fail to exceed budget or tax revenue figure bond market the action the fed could not burn it all down could it those who do not want to ask this question seriously be those who keep look away from the abyss because the abyss look back at they they refuse to consider what happen when the game board be so turn upside down when jenga's tower be so fragile that the only win move be to flick the table and watch it all crumble the fed have look into this chasm in the past and always walk away from it but that be when there be still time but the davos have push we to the brink of societal collapse across the west it have refuse to even consider that it be the abyss and because of this the fed may be face with the heroic choice to jump and let we pick up the piece the question have for you be simple what be you prepared to become if this happen we already know what the big player dothe big question we should all ask ourselves when it come to geopolitic,0
255,to say that the news be messy today would be the height of an understatement every day newspaper headline present we with new set of conflict datum that convince we of lie that serve someone's interest no matter how hard we try to keep up with the situation weed out the redundant stuff to find the useful information amid the din be full time job sometimes though it be good to take few step back get back to the basic and remember who the player be what they want and then ask each of they the big question do they succeed but in order to be able to ask this question we must honestly ask ourselves the follow question what will they be willing to do to survive in the current circumstance this be the most uncomfortable question you can ask someone what would you do to survive to protect your family your position the idea you have of yourself everyone have limit to their morality everyone everyone have shadow dark side place where they withdraw into their hobbesian self and see the world only in term of war of all against all anyone who refuse to admit it be someone you should scream away from those who always claim moral superiority who be always the good one be those who have no limit to their behavior as the great mencken proclaim almost 70 year ago the urge to save humanity be almost always pretense the real urge be to lead power be what all messiah really seek not the ability to serve this people true even for godly brother who take the gospel to foreign land it be in this context and we must ask this question what will they do of course the answer be anything they need this be why never discard anything in my analysis that be why always ready to step five or six step before the big move because that be the limit of the behavior of the group study today it may be davo tomorrow the fed the next day russia they all have preferred end state solution to their personal equation with their own combination of input variable see it as set of differential equation to solve we all want they to boil down to set of outcome that will get someone close to their preferred outcome and the scary part for all of we should be realize that not only be there not single combination where everyone's outcome be maximize there be not even win lose condition there be only loser we because the first rule of any organization be self survival throw mission statement corporate speech and hr virtue signal in the dumpster and set it on fire at the end of the day all that matter be survival only when this be nearly assure can an organization begin to think beyond its rep ##tilian brain like you and and at this point all the major faction have be reduce to this their horizon be just out of reach and they be strive to reach it because it be there ready but like zeno's paradox they never reach it because it be never possible to reach it in the first place what fear more than anything what see in too many people who analyze the relationship between geopolitic market and ideology be complacency there be surprising amount of normalcy bias in the analyst caste too many calm head will prevail and not enough they all have plan until they get punch in the face so when you think of davos and their state goal for the great reset and rescue the world from climate change do you really think there be limit to their behavior do you really believe that they will not start nuclear war that they will not unleash virulent plague that they will not create cure bad than the disease that they will not cause false flag shooting in school or that they will not release supreme court opinion when you think of the federal reserve in the context of an unprecedented assault on its autonomy and the commercial banking interest whose protection be its raison d'etre do you really think that today at this point would not it cause an economic collapse to save itself from another group say davos that would threaten all of this with destruction so all those who pontificate on the fait that the fed will only make one or two rate hike because that be what the model be say because that be what the fed's past behavior be suppose to tell they what will you tell your customer when the fed make fourth hike of 50 basis point or that it will accelerate the pace of quantitative tightening to 125 billion month and allow the us 10 year bond to hit 10 be you go to shrug your shoulder and say um sorry it be my fault face with the prospect of nuclear rearm ukraine ally with neoconservative ideologue in congress and the us state department commit to singular

262,an article from conflict the supreme court of the united states end the bureaucracy that intend to control the life of americans it would be urgent to protect the life of european citizen against the useless and liberticidal bureaucracy of brussels strasbourg in the space of fortnight the united states supreme court render historic decision in june 2022 that will have significant consequence for decade to come she begin by reaffirm that the right to bear arm be constitutional right that sport teacher have the right to pray silently on sport field and then in the dobbs case the court decide that the american constitution do not take side on the issue of abortion and that therefore the federal state do not have to deal with it and that it be up to the people and their elect representative to decide see the article very comprehensive by drieu godefridi these decision shock the politically correct world of europe which immediately criticize these decision without even bother to read the legal text president macron and other have even take the liberty of criticize decision by sovereign court in third state to conclude the series of decision from its june 2022 decision the us supreme court conclude that limit co emission from power plant should be decide by lawmaker and not by official of the environmental protection agency epa snub for joe biden aka barack obama like the dobbs decision west virginia epa be leak to the press on june 14 which be very unusual to try if possible to modify the vote before it become final an administrative investigation be underway unable to legislate on the decarbonization of power plant because america and therefore also the legislature be divide president barack obama have authorize the federal agency to enact law against coal plant the justice rule six to three that the epa have no right to take legislative power just as they do not speak out on the merit of abortion they do not speak forward on the climate but hint that the obama biden duo must go through congressional decision if it want to limit co emission the court consider that congress can not abdicate delegate its responsibility on major issue that affect the life of american citizen such as co emission since major policy must be approve by representative the administration attempt to legally impose its policy on capitol hill this situation have provoke many reaction and activist on both side of the atlantic be not let it go nathaniel keohane president of the center for climate and energy solution manipulate information like all activist do say the decision threaten to relegate the united states far behind our international partner who be accelerate their effort to meet their climate commitment we will see at the end of this article that if there be any acceleration it concern global co emission the wall street journal write that the three dissent justice lament that congress lack the expertise to regulate technical matter such as climate change in footnote justice gorsuch note the evil sic character of woodrow wilson progressive critic of the constitution and founder of the administrative state as believe in government by expert because the people be stupid the real problem for dissenter be that the constitution deliberately make it difficult to pass law it could be argue that in the eu it be the legislator who decide on these very complex issue but it must also be recognize that the european legislator have create chaos as we will see later the lawsuit be launch at the request of the state of west virginia which have lead coalition of 20 other republican state and coal company to challenge environmental official abuse of power which force coal and gas producer to subsidize renewable energy ministry or agency deal with the environment be environmental stronghold that be there to advocate for the cause have experience this in my professional life read the excellent analysis by philippe silberzahn when expert become activist environmental activist expert on june 30 2022 the european court of auditor publish report show that the european commission spend around one billion euro per year on external consultant between 2017 and 2020 the period during which the fit 55 decarbonization policy be design regard thee use of external consultant the court of auditor note that the use of these service nevertheless have significant shortcoming which create risk of excessive dependence and conflict of interest the commission do not sufficiently manage these risk and provide only limited information on the use of consultant oh sure not all of these consultant be necessarily environmentalist but if they dared not dance like the politically correct whistle they just would not get any more contract in the past it be the service of the european commission that control the expertise the kinock reform around 2000 remove technical skill from service and since then expertise have be provide by consultant and lobby the phenomenon be sublimate within the european parliament this result in increasingly complex decision which as we get into technical issue be not necessarily rational or balance the 2018 directive amend the 2012 energy efficiency directive contain 20 page of small print change to the 2012 directive which have 54 page 15 annexe and even complicated mathematical formula so difficult to write in text so there be currently 74 page of legislation in the official journal of the eu to explain how to do energy efficiency it be urgent and essential to return to pragmatic realism because the scale and the bureaucratic cost of our effort to reduce emission be increasingly detrimental to we in the field of decarbonization you will have notice that we talk less and less about sustainable development it be the environmental ngo that be the most influential just look at the implausible decision to ban thermal vehicle by 2035 while it be believe that the car manufacturer lobby be all powerful it be in fact the green lobby that have impose their will in the sector where europe be the leader this failure be such that the stellantis group 12 car brand decide to leave the acea lobby unable to defend its survival we will not dwell on the thorny question of subsidy in strasbourg and brussels where thousand of green lobbyist be pay through project control carbon be control life what should we conclude we have enter an extremely complex world that can no long be master as the implication be many and varied with equally complex timescale and feedback loop take the example of renewable energy at first glance brilliant and common sense idea but after 49 year of technological promotion and 22 year of market manipulation we be face an energy crisis that be hit citizen and industry hard german wind turbine will not be able to do anything to save the german chemical industry if vladimir putin decide to stop supply germany with the natural gas that the factory sorely need to operate it be urgent to stop this mad race which lead to disenchantment of the citizen for what have allow we to live 70 year of peace instead of peace we now have fear poverty and lack of freedom since as climatologist richard lindzen say if you control carbon you control life if the citizen do not react not only will the eu control every detail of our life but it will sink we even far in precariousness the rest of the world not bother with co emission datum from bp's statistical annual review release this week show global co emission have increase by 59 since the 1990 base year eu emission have fall by 27 and non oecd emission have increase by 135 our bureaucracy will never succeed in reduce global co emission coal consumption in china and india account for two third of global consumption the state of west virginia will continue thank to the united states supreme court to burn coal like the rest of the world just like we if vladimir putin take revenge on european sanction against russia by cut off the gas russianend of green bureaucracy in the us but not in the eu,0

representative to decide see the article very comprehensive by drieu godefridi these decision shock the politically correct world of europe which immediately criticize these decision without even bother to read the legal text president macron and other have even take the liberty of criticize decision by sovereign court in third state to conclude the series of decision from its june 2022 session the us supreme court conclude that limit co emission from power plant should be decide by lawmaker and not by official of the environmental protection agency epa snub for joe biden aka barack obama like the dobbs decision west virginia epa be leak to the press on june 14 which be very unusual to try if possible to modify the vote before it become final an administrative investigation be underway unable to legislate on the decarbonization of power plant because america and therefore also the legislature be divide president barack obama have authorize the federal agency to enact law against coal plant the justice rule six to three that the epa have no right to take legislative power just as they do not speak out on the merit of abortion they do not speak out on the climate but hint that the obama biden duo must go through congressional decision if it want to limit co emission the court consider that congress can not abdicate delegate its responsibility on major issue that affect the life of american citizen such as co emission since major policy must be approve by representative the administration attempt to legally impose its policy on capitol hill this decision have provoke many reaction and activist on both side of the atlantic be not let it go nathaniel keohane president of the center for climate and energy solution manipulate information like all activist do say the decision threaten to relegate the united states far behind our international partner who be accelerate their effort to meet their climate commitment we will see to the end of this article that if there be any acceleration it concern global co emission the wall street journal write that the three dissent justice lament that congress lack the expertise to regulate technical matter such as climate change in footnote justice gorsuch note the evil sic character of woodrow wilson progressive critic of the constitution and founder of the administrative state as believe in government by expert because the people be stupid the real problem for dissenter be that the constitution deliberately make it difficult to pass law it could be argue that in the eu it be the legislator who decide on these very complex issue but it must also be recognize that the european legislator have create chaos as we will see later the lawsuit be launch at the request of the state of west virginia which have lead coalition of 20 other republican state and coal company to challenge environmental official abuse of power which force coal and gas producer to subsidize renewable energy ministry or agency deal with the environment be environmental stronghold that be there to advocate for the cause have experience this in my professional life read the excellent analysis by philippe silberzahn when expert become activist environmental activist expert on june 30 2022 the european court of auditor publish report show that the european commission spend around one billion euro per year on external consultant between 2017 and 2020 the period during which the fit 55 decarbonization policy be design regard thee use of external consultant the court of auditor note that the use of these service nevertheless have significant shortcoming which create risk of excessive dependence and conflict of interest the commission do not sufficiently manage these risk and provide only limited information on the use of consultant oh sure not all of these consultant be necessarily environmentalist but if they dared not dance like the politically correct whistle they just would not get any more contract in the past it be the service of the european commission that control the expertise the kinock reform around 2000 remove technical skill from service and since then expertise have be provide by consultant and lobby the phenomenon be sublimate within the european parliament this result in increasingly complex decision which as we get into technical issue be not necessarily rational or balance the 2018 directive amend the 2012 energy efficiency directive contain 20 page of small print change to the 2012 directive which have 54 page 15 annexe and even complicated mathematical formula so difficult to write in text so there be currently 74 page of legislation in the official journal of the eu to explain how to do energy efficiency it be urgent and essential to return to pragmatic realism because the scale and the bureaucratic cost of our effort to reduce emission be increasingly detrimental to we in the field of decarbonization you will have notice that we talk less and less about sustainable development it be the environmental ngo that be the most influential just look at the implausible decision to ban thermal vehicle by 2035 while it be believe that the car manufacturer lobby be all powerful it be in fact the green lobby that have impose their will in the sector where europe be the leader this failure be such that the stellantis group 12 car brand decide to leave the acea lobby unable to defend its survival we will not dwell on the thorny question of subsidy in strasbourg and brussels where thousand of green lobbyist be pay through project control carbon be control life what should we conclude we have enter an extremely complex world that can no long be master as the implication be many and varied with equally complex timescale and feedback loop take the example of renewable energy at first glance brilliant and common sense idea but after 49 year of technological promotion and 22 year of market manipulation we be face an energy crisis that be hit citizen and industry hard german wind turbine will not be able to do anything to save the german chemical industry if vladimir putin decide to stop supply germany with the natural gas that the factory sorely need to operate it be urgent to stop this mad race which lead to disenchantment of the citizen for what have allow we to live 70 year of peace instead of peace we now have fear poverty and lack of freedom since as climatologist richard lindzen say if you control carbon you control life if the citizen do not react not only will the eu control every detail of our life but it will sink we even far in precariousness the rest of the world not bother with co emission datum from bp's statistical annual review release this week show global co emission have increase by 59 since the 1990 base year eu emission have fall by 27 and non oecd emission have increase by 135 our bureaucracy will never succeed in reduce global co emission coal consumption in china and india account for two third of global consumption the state of west virginia will continue thank to the united states supreme court to burn coal like the rest of the world just like we if vladimir putin take revenge on european sanction against russia by cut off the gas russianend of green bureaucracy in the us but not in the eu,0

12 moreover it be these same lake that partly destroys the river through canal system when we say that the lake be dry that do not mean that it be empty specifie matteo cislaghi hydrologist at the lombard agency for the protection of the environment arpa indeed below certain level the water can no long be release because not only would it no long reach the outlet mouth of the water reservoir but in addition it would kill the lake explain the hydrologist at the origin of this historic drought an accumulation of crisis snowfall have decrease by 70 this winter and precipitation by half since december the piedmont region go almost 110 day without drop of rain add to all this be exceptionally high temperature sometimes up to more cause the early melting of the little snow on the mountain peak consequence the availability of water do not allow all need to be meet at the environmental agricultural and industrial level analyze massimiliano pasqui researcher at the observatory on drought of the italian national research council cnr the farmer realize the fact nearly 50 of his corn production be compromise access to drinking water remain guarantee however confirm all the interlocutor contact however hundred of municipality across the region concern have decide to limit the use of water in milan for example it be forbid to fill your swimming pool or to clean your car with jet in piedmont two municipality have close the tap at night confirm the regional councilor responsible for the environment matteo marnati in area where the aqueduct be old there be problem with loss we manage to solve they by bring water in tank truck he explain the sector most affect by this crisis be agriculture like all producer in the po basin davide canegrati now live day to day depend on the weather forecast tuesday june 28 the rain be indeed there if it temporarily relieve the river and lake it be not enough to fill the water deficit the farmer realize the fact nearly 50 of his corn production be compromise since april we have be able to irrigate totally or partially only 30 hectare out of the 50 where the plant be grow he explain as for its 70 hectare of meadow they too be dry this production be use to feed his cow at the end of the season davide canegrati will surely have to choose between reduce his livestock by at least 25 or buy food elsewhere despite the soar price cause by the russian invasion in ukraine on large scale the entire agriculture of the po basin be at risk know that it alone produce nearly 40 of italian food include flagship product such as parmesan in lombardy wheat yield have already fall by 30 to 40 in some place say ermes sagula head of the assistance center at the coldiretti lombardy farmers association today the damage to italian agriculture be estimate at more than 500 million euro towards the end of the year we will surely have figure that exceed one billion he continue another production affect by the drought that of energy most hydroelectric plant be idle or have even be shut down such as that of serafini island 70 km southeast of milan by the end of 2022 we can expect drop in production of 55 to 60 for large plant and 70 to 75 for small one estimate assoidroelettrica an industry association it be particularly serious situation know that the energy which will not be produce with water will have to be produce with gas the price of which be extremely high insist paolo taglioli general manager of the association and whose greenhouse gas emission will make the problem bad we have the illusion that this resource be infinite when it be not to deal with the crisis the po river basin authority insist the withdrawal of available water must be reduce by 20 then the solution will have to be think out in the long term because the urgency be structural recall matteo marnati indeed all indicator show that such episode will become more frequent temperature be rise and our glacier be shrink analyzes orietta cazzuli head of the arpa meteorological service as for precipitation we have no sign of decrease but it could be less and less regular and more intense proposal be therefore on the table to avoid run out of steam in the future matteo marnati be push for the creation of new dam in the piedmont region in order to capture more rainwater with nearly 600 dyke and around fifteen lake lombardy be region rich in water resource what be need be well water management say damiano sirmine of the environmental association legambiente accord to he regional agriculture mainly base on rice and corn particularly water intensive crop must adapt we have to accept that in this climate change scenario agriculture will have to modify its production choice he continue to all this massimiliano pasqui add cultural change you have to learn to save water we have the illusion that this resource be infinite when it be not especially since in recent week the drought alarm have also start to sound in the central region of the country such as tuscany marche and lazio on monday july the government declare state of emergency in five northern region and announce the release of fund of 36. 5 million euro to deal with this

have already reach point of no return what perhaps we fail to keep rise temperature below in this eventuality scientist be work on last chance solution geoengineere solution that would limit the damage or even reverse climate change geoengineere bring together all the technique that make it possible to manipulate the earth's climate and environment inspire by an idea suggest by astronomer robert angel an mit team be currently work on concept of solar shield whose role would be to attenuate the solar radiation that reach our planet indeed if effort to mitigate co2 emission prove insufficient to reverse climate change it would already be essential to act directly on our main source of heat the project call space bubble consist of kind of giant raft make up of frozen bubble roughly the size of brazil accord to the team which would be position at the lagrange point l1 between the sun and the earth the structure would be design to reflect some of the sunlight the advantage of this approach over other geoengineere project such as dissolving chemical in the stratosphere to increase its albedo be that it would not directly impact earth's biosphere thin film bubble directly inflate in space when it come to geoengineere solar geoengineering have be little explore in 1989 james early present in the journal of the british interplanetary society concept of thin glass shield to compensate for the greenhouse effect cause by the accumulation of co2 this shield be to be construct from lunar material and position at the first lagrange point of the earth sun system in order to absorb some of the radiation such shield would decrease incident light by 1. 8 enough to reverse current warming there be issue at the time with the amount of material need to make this giant sun

homogeneous molten material like silicon can provide the variation in thickness that refract broad wave spectrum and allow we to avoid the need to cast large structural film element the researcher explain shield that could be in place before the end of the century it be question here of manufacture the reflective sphere directly in space which would limit transport cost the solution would also be completely reversible the bubble could be destroy simply by break their surface equilibrium which would also minimize space debris compare to other approach it could therefore be one of the most

manufacture of bubble in the laboratory under the condition of outer space they be particularly interested in silicon base molten mixture and graphene enhance ionic liquid which have ultra low vapor pressure and relatively low density the thermal and optical property of the material will also have to be take into account for the design. feasibility study accord to the researcher the minimum

whether the jet stream have change and the weather pattern be therefore last long the mere fact that it have become warm automatically mean that the probability of extreme precipitation increase explain the climate scientist at the geomar helmholtz center for ocean research in kiel mojib latif conversely the great evaporation also lead to more drought those be two side of the same coin say the oceanographer the jet stream be band of wind over the northern hemisphere that blow at an altitude of five to ten kilometer at speed of up to 500 kilometer per hour shift high and low pressure area eastward but in 2018 nothing work for month the high and low hang over each region phenomenon we may see more and more often and that be not all this week study by efi rousi from the potsdam

like in north america they find out that the jet stream divide over long and long period of time one arm lie over southern eurasia the other over northern eurasia this affect western europe in particular in this region the weather system usually come from the atlantic and therefore have cool effect however when the double jet occur the weather system be deflect northward and sustained heat wave can develop in western europe explain rousi the form of the azore high have also change since the beginning of industrialization in recent study in nature geoscience we scientist be able to use simulation to show that in these last 1200 year it have never expand as much as it have since 1850 since then very large high pressure area have also occur much more frequently as result the iberian

electricity due to storm ship get into distress off the coast but it can not be tow into port or evacuate at the moment for this reason the portland bay be tow far out to sea however the reason for the flooding be not the storm but heavy rain because warm air can hold more water such event be increase in many country around the world due to global warming in february march and april severe flooding have already occur in eastern australia where sydney be also locate at that time more than 20 people die and there be insure damage of 3. 2 billion euro estimate the australian industry

that would almost double in 40 year eastern australia will be particularly affect the deloitte report estimate that two third of the damage will occur in this part of the country this be partly because the big city like sydney melbourne brisbane and canberra be locate there and partly because of climate change not only heavy rain event continue to increase but also tropical cyclone because of the warm sea water these be get far and far south where the big city be australia's new normal christopher mueller melt glacier in italy after mass of ice rubble and snow bury several climber on

little snowfall in winter this favor the disaster between the 19th and early 21st century temperature in the alp rise twice as fast as the global average report copernicus the eu's earth observation

of the most recent rain disaster at the end of may in the coastal region of the north eastern state deforestation of gallery forest and atlantic rainforest rampant urban sprawl and land depletionlung be the main cause but climate change be also partly to blame this be the conclusion reach by research team from the world weather attribution initiative which take close look at the catastrophe without human cause global warming rainfall in the northeast would have be about fifth less intense the researcher say they assume that extreme heavy rain event will become more frequent and more violent in the region in the brazilian amazon region climate researcher have find that the atmosphere over the rainforest have become dry over the past 20 year make drought more likely on the one hand the cause be the progressive deforestation and slash and burn for the expansion of cattle pasture and soybean field but global warming be contribute to this reduction in humidity in the amazonian atmosphere another consequence be already clearly visible in the north of rio de janeiro the rise in sea level since the 1960s the sea have be eat its way in the estuary of the rio paraiba do sul at

seven meter for comparison the ahr normally have water depth of just over 70 centimetre 141 people die in the flood in the ahr valley more than 220 people die in the entire flood area which also affect belgium and the netherland in addition to the federal state of north rhine westphalia and rhineland palatinate scientist be quickly able to explain to what extent global warming have contribute to the flood disaster two factor in particular play prominent role first as temperature rise so do the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere the german weather service dwd assume temperature increase of 1. 6 degree in germany between the year 1881 and 2019 this mean that the proportion of water vapor have increase by 11. 5 percent over this period more water vapor mean more rain incidentally so be the risk of thunderstorm second factor the jet stream be decrease and move north the band of strong wind be slow because the temperature differential between the tropic and polar region that otherwise drive it have decrease instead of continuous wind the jet stream today often run in wave this increasingly lead to very slow move or even stand bet event this combination enable extreme rainfall in the flood region more than 150 liter per square meter be measure within 24 hour unusual amount of rain and the narrow development of the valley ultimately lead to the disaster on

that be is the case the sar cov virus be nothing more than seasonal flu that could have be cure with the exist treatment method and effective prevention base on strengthen the immune system ban treatment discredit the effectiveness of drug that have be use for decade the decision to place elderly who have fall ill in nursing home and the introduction of experimental gene therapy that have prove not only destructive but harmful and often deadly all of this confirm to we that the pandemic be plan and manage with the aim of cause the great possible damage this be fact establish and confirm by the official datum although these datum have be systematically falsify certainly those who want to manage the pandemic in this way be not ready to give in easily now in part because there be multi billion dollar interest behind all of this but what they want do not always have to happen same response to pandemic worldwide in your opinion be the pandemic handle in this way out of inexperience your excellency or be it due to the corruption of those responsible who be in conflict of interest because they be pay by the pharmaceutical industry this be the second element to consider the response to the pandemic have be the same across the world health authority slavishly conform to health protocol that run counter to the scientific literature and medical evidence and instead follow the directive of self proclaim one expert know for their sensational failure their apocalyptic utterly unrealistic prediction and their grave conflict of interest we can not believe that million of doctor around the world have lose their basic medical knowledge and believe that you should let the flu grow into pneumonia and then treat it with tachypirin or put the patient on ventilator if they do so it be because of the pressure to the point of blackmail by the health authority on medical worker with the help of scandalous campaign of medium terrorism and with the support of western leader most of these leader be member of lobby the world economic forum which have train they and place they at the high level of national and international institution to ensure that those in power be compliant klaus schwab have publicly boast on many occasion that he be able to intervene even with religious leader these be also document fact in all the country that have follow the instruction of the who and the pharmaceutical company there be clearly single script under single direction this prove the existence of criminal plan and the evil of its creator silent coup since the 1990s in some of your other statement you have speak of golpe bianco silent putsch silent coup be coup d'etat that take place without the use of force and be carry out by government that exercise its power in an unconstitutional manner in this case the coup be carry out almost simultaneously in all western country begin in the early 1990 in italy this coup begin with the divestment of company in which investment have be make and the privatization of service that normally drain the treasury such as health and transport on the order of high finance which mario draghi order on april 1941 june 1992 on the yacht britannia yes mario draghi who be director general of the treasury at the time and the then president of the italian republicik call francesco cossiga cowardly businessman in other

government bond swing speculate and together with hunter biden finance biological laboratory in ukraine to believe that there be no connection between the instigator of these crime and those who carry they out at the high level of national government the eu and the un be sign of suspicion because even child could understand that we be talk about group of ideologically deviant and morally corrupt technocrat be hold hostage the people of the world must reclaim their sovereignty which have be usurp by the globalist elite ruler want the people to be wipe out the instigator of this crime proudly show up at the davos forum at the meeting of the trilateral commission or the bilderberg group together with the ruler the prime minister the director of newspaper and television channel the ceo of social banker and the director of social platform and multinational corporation the banker and the director of rating agency the president of foundation and self proclaim philanthropist they all share the same agenda which they post on their website and be so confident in their own power that they affirm with impunity as soros and schwab recently do that there be need to create narrative that go beyond the mainstream medium to make their decision acceptable to the people censorship and mass manipulation be use by they as an instrumentum regni and we have see this in both the pandemic farce and the pro zelensky propaganda in ukraine we must understand that our ruler be traitor to our nation dedicate to the annihilation of the population and that all their action be aim at cause maximum harm to the citizen this be not problem of inexperience or inability but of intentio nocendi intentionally to harm honest citizen find it inconceivable that those who rule they do so with the perverse intent of undermine and destroy they make it difficult for they to believe it the root cause of this serious problem lie in the corruption of authority and the resign obedience of the govern church leader heretic and traitor the catholic church too have experience the same cognitive dissonance begin with the second vatican council revolution and especially during the final nine year of the bergoglian pontificate the faithful and the clergy have resign themselves to obey mere cynical official no less corrupt and pervert than their deep state counterpart although it be evident that the aim of the allege reform be always the systematic destruction of the church by its high leader who be heretic and traitor and find that the deep church have resort to the same false argument to obscure the doctrinal moral and liturgical dissolution first of all the false claim that these reform be demand from the ground up and not impose by force from above just as the reform plan by the world economic forum the bilderberg group and the trilateral be adopt by their infiltrator at the high level of nation and international organization and appear to have their plan ratify by popular approval distinguish between obedience and submission and what be your advice your excellency to get out of this impasse respect for authority be innate in civilized man but it be necessary to distinguish between obedience and submission you see every virtue consist of the just mean between two opposite vice without be compromise but also so to speak as the summit between two valley disobedience sin by fall short by not want to submit to good command from legitimate authority submissiveness on the other hand sin excessively submit to order that be unjust or give by an illegitimate authority the good citizen should know how to disobey civil authority and the good catholic should do the same with ecclesiastical authority disobeying when authority demand obedience to an unjust ordinance earthly authority always subordinate to the royal authority of the lord do not this talk seem bit revolutionary to you your excellency not even close the anarchist and the courtier both have distorted notion of authority some deny it other idolize it the just mean be the only morally practicable way because it correspond to the order which the lord have impose on the world and which the heavenly hierarchy respect we owe obedience to legitimate authority to the extent that it exercise its power for the purpose for which it be appoint by god the temporal good of the citizen in the case of the state and the spiritual good of the believer in the case of the church an authority that inflict evil on its subject be therefore illegitimate and its order be void let we not forget that the true lord from whom all authority emanate be god and that authority on earth both civil and spiritual be always representative that be subordinate to the authority of jesus christ the king and high priest be subordinate substitute the vicarious authority of ruler for the royal authority of the lord be crazy gesture and yes revolutionary and rebellious elite want to establish totalitarian regime through high treason and subversion what do the elite want to achieve it promise we peace security prosperity and job but at the moment there be more than fifty armed conflict in the world our city be uninhabitable fill with criminal decay and rule by dissident minority this be the third undeniable element that can not be overlook the pandemic be conceive as tool to establish totalitarian regime conceive by unelected technocrat with no sense of democratic representation the same be happen with the ukraine crisis the majority of citizen be absolutely not in favor of send arm to ukraine and impose sanction on the russian federation and yet the leader act as if they have the full support of their own nation aid by embarrassing distortion of reality by the mainstream

condition of the member state express series of recommendation with which the process of surveillance of the budget policy but not only of the state surveillance which as part of the post pandemic recovery plan be closely link to the disbursement of fund from the next generation eu program and therefore to the pnrr in fact as ursula von der leyen president of the european commission recall with reference to the specific recommendation for each country until now it depend only on the country to respect they or not but now the recommendation be link to subsidy and potential loan obviously there be also some for italy and read it make one's arm drop already on the front page the report tell we who we be and where we come from and perhaps that be the only thing we have to thank he for because with simple graph he remind we erase the unbearable rhetoric of the various good who have follow that since the financial crisis of 2008 not only have the gap with the other european economy dramatically increase but even the pandemic have catch italy with real gdp still low than the pre 2008 level the rest be recent history the most significant fall in gdp in europe during 2020 rebound which unlike what happen in other country be largely insufficient to recover the lost ground the gdp line which with the war return to become horizontal and at level that be always low than in 2008 in short 15 year in which we have lose ground not only in relative sense but also in an absolute sense what the report incidentally forget to mention be that in these fifteen year and in total from 2011 until the beginning of the pandemic we have be among the most diligent student in carry out homework read apply austerity measure with continuous primary surplus and see what little social measure remained faithfully apply the advice that we find in the report of previous year in short reading that to be honest be equivalent to rejection of the master programme not of the pupil but anyhow the report dedicate to italy cheerfully shrug and propose the usual recipe make up of cut reform and the only novelty wait for the pnrr continue with the description of the exist situation the drafter of the report regret that also due to the non temporary measure adopt in the last two year the public deficit will continue to exceed the magical threshold of regret the good time for they of the 2019 when we have reduce it to 1. 5 also thank to an impressive series of primary surplus yet today we know well what this mean during the pandemic for example in term of lack of service hospital staff bed or chicken coop class and dilapidate structure just to mention two of the most affected sector we continue with the inevitable excessive macroeconomic imbalance imbalance which translate in the language of the commission as excessive public debt public debt to be cut indiscriminately especially through the reduction of public spending thus go to aggravate the already dramatic situation of public service in italy and unemployment the latter be obviously an imbalance that the commission can tolerate furthermore the structural weakness of the labor market be mention even if the commission must also recognize that the partial recovery in the level of employment after the pandemic be essentially due to precarious work last but not least the report remind we that italy be among the european country most dependent on russian gas and that therefore it will probably suffer the most from the economic repercussion of the war if this be the state of the art the outlook on the future be if possible even more depressing give the need to resume the march towards balanced budget and with all due respect to those who rejoice at the suspension of the stability pact after all if we be the good we self inflict austerity all hope seem to be place in the salvific property of the pnrr with respect to which it should be remember that italy be the large beneficiary in absolute term and one of the only four country to have also request access to loan put aside that as we have already explain elsewhere this intervention be largely insufficient when not openly contradictory whatwhat really impress be see the various reform associate with the pnrr line up cut bureaucracy to heal public administration that be insufficiently responsive to the need of business sic reform of the public sector and the example give be that of temporary expert hire precisely for the management of the pnrr liberalization in particular for public service see local transport water garbage etc in

to be reform by shift the weight more to taxis on consumption and particularly low rate be target the tool to try to mitigate the effect of structurally regressive tax and on real estate include first home however the european commission be in good indeed bad company the annual surveillance mission to italy of the international monetary fund end on 17 may and even in this case before leave the expert think it appropriate to leave we few advice in addition to call for broken record credible two pronged strategy to significantly reduce the high deficit and debt over the medium term this report focus more on the economic consequence of the war by make it clear that the fiscal response to the energy shock should be more contained than what happen for the pandemic the solution in this case be identify in the repower eu plan therefore practically nothing and on social bonus see the recent and largely insufficient aid decree also in this case the most interesting thing lie in what the report do not say in the presence of crazy bill go ahead and give few coin to those more on the ground but woe to request more profound and structural intervention by the state in regulate the market even timid intervention on some bill item such as excise duty and system charge be discourage because although this immediately reduce price for family and business energy efficiency be discourage and the advantage be for the benefit of all consumer in conclusion the european commission and the international monetary fund be call for order effectively propose the same recipe thank to which we be find without tool in the face of the disaster of the pandemic we know that the improvement of our quality of life pass through an exactly opposite path relaunching of social spending by the state and local authority which also mean current spending for example to pay doctor nurse teacher etc political coherent environmental and energy policy stable employment contract and decent wage

skeptic and then there be the other league that of the territory which every day have to face the bulletin of hospitalization due to the virus the one of those who have see many of their fellow citizen die from the first wave of covid and have no problem come to confrontation even with their own party mate and that of those who know how much the virus can hurt and for this reason try to convert the no vax just broaden your gaze little go beyond the council of minister and salvini's statement to see that this second league be gain more and more ground and even if no one openly expose himself he look at salvini's line with some annoyance too wavering and ambiguous accord to those who have understand that covid must be fight primarily by protect as many people as possible in the front row among the northern league supporter in favor of the vaccine be roberto calderoli the vice president of the senate tell corriere today that he spend the christmas holiday between the fear of be infect and an attempt to convert non vax relative five time out of seven he succeed those who persist in not acknowledge reality he say would force he to see what happen in the hospital ward his line be very clear which certainly clash with that of those who with his own card in his wallet be instead ambiguous or even oppose to the vaccine and the green pass the most recent example on this front concern two brother from sassuolo both councilor both northern league supporter they have decide to resign because they be against the vaccine and therefore without super green pass the choice do not move calderoli one millimeter who reply the world will go on anyway we will find two more responsible councilor to find northern league supporter who have repeatedly expose themselves in favor of vaccine even at the cost of end up in the crosshair of no vax just look at the region massimiliano fedriga and robert zaia both lead member of the carroccio be at the forefront of the vaccination campaign have an obligation to tell the truth to citizen do not have it with no vax but get vaccinate be the solution we can not continue to spread the alibi that this virus be cure at home that be enough 93 be treat at home but without pneumology and intensive care many would have die the president of the veneto region say in december and this be just one of his many utterance that have go in this direction massimiliano fedriga be no less the governor of friuli venezia giulia be among the first to invoke differentiated regime between vaccinate and non vaccinate in case the epidemiological situation worsen as indeed it be then his exposure cost he the threat of some no vax and the stash understand why those who administer the territory have very clear line in favor of the vaccine be quite simple if you listen to the word of pierpaolo roberti councilor for local autonomy and the public function of friuli venezia giulia in november he be the protagonist of question and answer on twitter with claudio borghi member of parliament of the league who be very critical of the rule on the green pass the reason for the clash be the increase in covid case in friuli venezia giulia due to the conjunction between no vax demonstration and the low percentage of immunize people return to that story roberti tell huffpost as from trieste can say that the difference in sensitivity on the subject be not only the prerogative of the league we who administer the territory however in addition to have privileged observatory have different role we be the one who see the bulletin of infection and hospitalization every day and the percentage of vaccinate if you touch thing firsthand if you see the number that be the sense of his reasoning one can only take one fact for grant the vaccine reduce serious case cut down on hospitalization and if someone be still skeptical on the subject roberti reply with the most recent datum right now in friuli venezia giulia we have 40 people in intensive care thirty five be unvaccinate the commissioner have repeatedly expose himself on social medium against no vaxe and do not hide that he have receive more than few attack but do not even pay attention to it it be not even worth waste your time be minority very noisy but still minority in the same way he be convince that try to change the mind of the no vax hard core be now lose battle fight in the name of what be now an ideology the extension of the vaccination obligation which salvini do not like at all could ebe solution can not imagine real form of obligation conclude roberti and would like to remind you that the no vax have even accept to lose their job do not think they would stop in front of the obligation in the group of pro vax northern league supporter there be also the deputy from bergamo cristian invernizzi the protagonist of heavy bickering in the chamber with his colleague from the carroccio golinelli on the rule on the super green pass hear in the follow day he tone down the tone but reiterate he who have see many fellow citizen die and his father feel very ill due to the virus the importance of vaccine that there be double line and some annoyance for the position of the boss be now evident but those directly involve be careful not to make it manifest also because if you expose yourself too much you risk disciplinary proceeding within the party this could be the fate of giantonio da re veneto eurodeputy del carroccio on january in an interview with corriere launch very harsh attack on salvini the ambiguity of my party and my secretary be put at long time discomfort it have always be unjustifiable now it have become unsustainable he say and the thud of stone would have make less noise the next day alberto stefani commissioner of the venetian liga say he would like to bring da re's position before the regional executive da re have already be warn he say accord to what the via solferino newspaper report one do not go out in the newspaper argue against the federal secretariat everything suggest that all the other dissatisfied with salvini's line on vaccine will be careful not to use the same tone as the mep but the discontent be there

this direction massimiliano fedriga be no less the governor of friuli venezia giulia be among the first to invoke differentiated regime between vaccinate and non vaccinate in case the epidemiological

the social democrats the liberal party and the pirate party be the pirate party be an anti establishment movement form in 2012 in response to the collapse of the icelandic banking system after the 2008 financial crisis it be pro democracy populist political force with anarchist libertarian and anti copyright leaning direct great transparency by company and the nationalization of natural

549,russia's aggressiveness be alarm the scandinavian island in search of great security just like sweden and finland for brussels it will be strategic outpost between the atlantic and the north sea an area where it lose influence after brexit icelander be increasingly look to the european union with great interest this be testify by survey carry out by the opinion poll institute gallup accord to which 47 of citizen be in favor of join the european union the high figure in the last 12 year while 33 be against sympathy for brussels have grow over time in 2010 only 26 of icelander want to join while in 2014 the figure have grow to 37 the acceleration in recent month be link to the ukrainian crisis and the search for great security with membership of the community bloc the same happen to finland and sweden which apply to join nato iceland be already part of the atlantic alliance and have follow parallel path the benefit of possible icelandic membership for brussels be not link to the energy sector that be to one of the most delicate issue in the ukrainian dossier reykjavik possess capacities of natural gas and oil and therefore could not increase the community reserve favor reduction of dependence on russia what make iceland strategic be its position crucial for control the sea route that guarantee access to the atlantic ocean and the north sea the friction between the west and russia have give new importance to that part of the world forget after the end of the cold war moscow intend to exploit it to expand the range of action of its naval and submarine fleet while the european union have lose ground after 2006 furthermore relation between iceland and russia worsen after reykjavik's choice to join the european union's sanction against moscow iceland be deeply integrate with the union because it be part of the european economic area the schengen area participate without the right to vote in some program and agency and consult with the union on foreign policy matter frequently align with the position express by the latter in matter of international affair and take part in civilian peacekeeping mission that be establish in july 2009 after financial crisis and snap election iceland apply to become member of the european union for the first time the consultation have produce change in government with the alternation between the conservative of the independence party and the pro european of the social democratic alliance membership of the union be see as way to end the crisis by adopt the euro and as logical choice to have more decision make power in european politic the scenario however change rapidly iceland recover quickly from the crisis while the union sink into it also complicate bilateral relation the 2013 general election end with the victory of the progressive party which despite its name be center right political force and the independence party prime minister sigmundur davið gunnlaugsson say that the government would stop negotiation between iceland and the european union and that the latter would not resume until referendum be hold the progressive party be against the negotiation because it fear that union membership would undermine reykjavik's control of fishing stock iceland have one of the most modern and productive fishing industry in the world and to maintain sustainable fish stock and protect the marine ecosystem annual quota be set which impose an upper limit on activity in this sector the ministry of fishery as recall by the bbc in 2016 be the most important department of the icelandic government and the then minister gunnar bragi sveinsson explain that he would never have choose to join the european union because in this way the iceland should not have share decision in the fishery sector with 27 or 28 other country make everything more complicated and give up the quota system not envisage by community policy in 2015 the application to join the european union be withdraw the 2017 consultation end with the election of parliament make up of two third by eurosceptic deputy and with the formation of grand coalition government lead by katrin jakobsdottir of the red green movement hostile towards the european union the executive be then reconfirm after the 2021 election in march of this year with the invasion of ukraine having begin few day ago fourteen deputy submit bill to parliament which provide for the summoning of kingnational referendum which should take place by the end of the year to ask the population whether iceland should restart accession negotiation with the

558,the conflict between russia and ukraine have lead to global food crisis at time of climate change pollution and other threat to the food supply in the near future food problem be likely to be global problem while conflict result from crop war will also become an international issue of major concern since 2016 darpa the united states advanced military research institute have be carry out defense program know as insect ally which it say be suppose to address potential risk associate with the food supply however in this program the pentagon use insect to insert genetically modify virus into the cellular dna of plant which could affect crop growth by change the gene express by the plant themselves accord to medium report after the announcement the plan have receive widespread criticism from scientist and expert around the world who have warn that insect ally could open an easily weaponize technological pandora's box even the intention of the pentagon be not clear be it really about save humanity from hunger or on the contrary deliberately provoke humanitarian crisis to pursue some military purpose accord to expert interview by global time insect ally be turn this concern into real danger why do they use insect as vector why be the united states build biological laboratory near other country such as russia when pandora's box be open series of disaster will follow say an expert however this be just the tip of the iceberg of project that could easily turn into biological weapon in addition to the insect ally program the united states have conduct biological experiment around the world in its famous bio laboratory ignore safety and ethic principle and flagrantly in violation of the biological weapon convention insect become biological weapon the defense advanced research project agency the be research and development agency of the united states department of defense responsible for the development of high tech military application ever since darpa announce the insect ally program in the name of disaster prevention and increase agricultural productivity the controversy around the proposal have never cease accord to darpa's website the program pursue scalable readily implementable and generalizable countermeasure against potential natural and engineer threat to the food supply with the goal of preserve the agricultural system accord to darpa the program by apply targeted therapy seek to mitigate the impact of possible threat to the crop system include natural threat and those introduce by state or non state actor that could rapidly threaten national security accord to darpa the insect ally program study the possibility of modify the genetic heritage of plant through vector insect and the plant virus they transmit involve three technical problems viral manipulation optimization of insect vector and selective gene therapy in plant ripe to achieve this goal the 45 million project have fund at least four research institute as report by the medium in 2017 one of insect ally experiment reportedly involve corn and tomato plant and dispersive insect specie include grasshopper whiteflies aleurodid and aphid however the project and darpa's intention have not convince the scientist as early as april 2018 an article in science warn that crop protector insect select in the insect ally program could be turn into bioweapon if successful the technique could be use by malicious actor to help spread disease in nearly any crop specie and devastate crop it read the research could constitute violation of the biological weapon convention continue the science article which quote european scientist the program could be widely perceive as an effort to develop hostile biological agent and their mean of delivery critic note also accord to germany's max planck institute the insect ally program could easily be misuse for the development of biological weapon in critical review publish in january 2022 in the society of environmental toxicology and chemistry scientist note that the combination of virus induce genetic modification of plant grow on thefield with genetically modify insect vector pose great risk than the current use of genetically modify organism in 2019 forbe list insect ally as one of the tech ethical issue we should all be think about be it biological weapon will it motivate other country to develop the technology to defend themselves forbe wonder zhang jie an expert at the plant protection institute of the chinese academy of agricultural science caas tell the global time that the possibility of use insect as vector of harmful bacteria and virus to attack crop and cause food crisis not only exist but also have large margin of development he say the three main crop rice wheat and maize all have lethal virus bacteria or fungus in fact target pest such as the rice leafhopper and wheat aphid can carry different virus to infect crop cause enormous damage it would be lethal to turn an insect into bioweapon because until now virus in crop have be very difficult to control once an infected crop develop symptom it be nearly impossible to save and the virus continue to vary make prevention even more difficult zhang say zhou huanbin colleague of zhang who study genome editing tell the global time that certain principle must be follow in crop gene edit one of which be to minimize the risk of uncontrolled spread of genetically modify crop also on the project's controllability gregory kaebnick an ethicist at the hastings center bioethic research institute in new york be quote by the ap as say that once introduce to field insect and microbe may be impossible to to remove he warn that insect ally technology could end up be destructive violation of the biological weapon convention the insect ally plan have be label bioweapon by western scholar from the day it be announce spark heated discussion in western academic circle and the medium about whether the plan could violate the united nations biological weapon convention bwc because of the broad prohibition of the biological weapon convention any biological research of concern must be plausibly justify as be for peaceful purpose the insect ally program could be consider violation of the biological weapon convention if the reason present by darpa be implausible read the max planck institute article cornerstone of international biological weapon control the bwc be ready for signature in 1972 and go into effect in 1975 with over 180 signatory state the united states first push for the cancellation of the bwc and later become the only country to oppose the establishment of multilateral verification mechanism for compliance with the convention use insect as vector to spread disease be classic biological weapon silja voeneky professor of international law at the university of freiburg in germany tell the washington post accord to voeneky the use of insect as key element in this program be particularly alarming because insect could be employ cheaply and surreptitiously by malicious actor his concern be echo by chinese military expert song zhongpe who call the insect ally technology typical form of biological weapon it could reduce crop yield in target country and artificially create food crisis in this way the affected country would lose its independence in the food sector and could become dependent on we food export even for genetically modify food which be part of biological warfare song say song believe that the united states should explain why insect should be use as vector in this research especially since insect could safely spread virus in other country crop it be not hard to see why the united states have set up biological lab near rival nation because only then can lab work with native specie he say for example it would be problematic if they bring american bug into ukrainian lab and then release they in russia long history of use insect vector the insect ally program be just one of many instance where us research have be accuse of cause dire consequence around the world especially through the use of biological laboratory the united states have openly admit to gexpand 336 biological laboratory in 30 country of the world of which 26 in ukraine however the sign contract suggest that the united states have open laboratory in 49 country far more than officially recognize one the pentagon have long history of use insect as disease vector accord to partially declassified 1981 report by the us military us biological warfare scientist have conduct several experiment on insect in the 1980 the us army's institute of medical research on infectious disease conduct experiment to test whether sand fly and mosquito could be vector of rift valley virus dengue chikungunya and eastern equine encephalitis accord to bulgarian investigative journalist dilyana gaytandzhieva the us military have be study their possible use as biological weapon in the same decade as part of us military operation call may day the aede aegupti mosquito be disperse in the state of georgia use terrestrial method mosquito be believe to be vector of dengue chikungunya and the zika virus gaytandzhieva also reveal that the pentagon would conduct entomological warfare test in country such as georgia and russia in 2014 the lugar center build in the united states near tbilisi the capital of georgia have be equip with an insect research facility and launch project call raise awareness about barcode of sand fly in georgia and caucasus in the follow year two other program have be start at the same centre as result since 2015 tbilisi have be infest with bite fly that have develop behavior atypical of local specie such as be able to survive all year round indoor and be highly resistant to cold biting fly have also be find in the neighboring dagestan region of russia furthermore while conduct research on deadly virus and bacteria the united states have be unable to ensure the safety of its biological laboratory the pentagon admit in 2015 that in 2003 live anthrax sample have be mistakenly send from the military base at dugway

institute as report by the medium in 2017 one of insect ally experiment reportedly involve corn and tomato plant and dispersive insect specie include grasshopper whiteflies aleurodid and aphid however the project and darpa's intention have not convince the scientist as early as april 2018 an article in science warn that crop protector insect select in the insect ally program could be turn into bioweapon if successful the technique could be use by malicious actor to help spread disease in nearly any crop specie and devastate crop it read the research could constitute violation of the biological weapon convention continue the science article which quote european scientist the program could be widely perceive as an effort to develop hostile biological agent and their mean of delivery critic note also accord to germany's max planck institute the insect ally program could easily be misuse for the development of biological weapon in critical review publish in january 2022 in the society of environmental toxicology and chemistry scientist note that the combination of virus induce genetic modification of plant grow on thefield with genetically modify insect vector pose great risk than the current use of genetically modify organism in 2019 forbe list insect ally as one of the tech ethical issue we should all be think about be it biological weapon will it motivate other country to develop the technology to defend themselves forbe wonder zhang jie an expert at the plant protection institute of the chinese academy of agricultural science caas tell the global time that the possibility of use insect as vector of harmful bacteria and virus to attack crop and cause food crisis not only exist but also have large margin of development he say the three main crop rice wheat and maize all have lethal virus bacteria or fungus in fact target pest such as the rice leafhopper and wheat aphid can carry different virus to infect crop cause enormous damage it would be lethal to turn an insect into bioweapon because until now virus in crop have be very difficult to control once an infected crop develop symptom it be nearly impossible to save and the virus continue to vary make prevention even more difficult zhang say zhou huanbin colleague of zhang who study genome editing tell the global time that certain principle must be follow in crop gene edit one of which be to minimize the risk of uncontrolled spread of genetically modify crop also on the project's controllability gregory kaebnick an ethicist at the hastings center bioethic research institute in new york be quote by the ap as say that once introduce to field insect and microbe may be impossible to to remove he warn that insect ally technology could end up be destructive violation of the biological weapon convention the insect ally plan have be label bioweapon by western scholar from the day it be announce spark heated discussion in western academic circle and the medium about whether the plan could violate the united nations biological weapon convention bwc because of the broad prohibition of the biological weapon convention any biological research of concern must be plausibly justify as be for peaceful purpose the insect ally program could be consider violation of the biological weapon convention if the reason present by darpa be implausible read the max planck institute article cornerstone of international biological weapon control the bwc be ready for signature in 1972 and go into effect in 1975 with over 180 signatory state the united states first push for the cancellation of the bwc and later become the only country to oppose the establishment of multilateral verification mechanism for compliance with the convention use insect as vector to spread disease be classic biological weapon silja voeneky professor of international law at the university of freiburg in germany tell the washington post accord to voeneky the use of insect as key element in this program be particularly alarming because insect could be employ cheaply and surreptitiously by malicious actor his concern be echo by chinese military expert song zhongpe who call the insect ally technology typical form of biological weapon it could reduce crop yield in target country and artificially create food crisis in this way the affected country would lose its independence in the food sector and could become dependent on we food export even for genetically modify food which be part of biological warfare song say song believe that the united states should explain why insect should be use as vector in this research especially since insect could safely spread virus in other country crop it be not hard to see why the united states have set up biological lab near rival nation because only then can lab work with native specie he say for example it would be problematic if they bring american bug into ukrainian lab and then release they in russia long history of use insect vector the insect ally program be just one of many instance where us research have be accuse of cause dire consequence around the world especially through the use of biological laboratory the united states have openly admit to gexpand 336 biological laboratory in 30 country of the world of which 26 in ukraine however the sign contract suggest that the united states have open laboratory in 49 country far more than officially recognize one the pentagon have long history of use insect as disease vector accord to partially declassified 1981 report by the us military us biological warfare scientist have conduct several experiment on insect in the 1980 the us army's institute of medical research on infectious disease conduct experiment to test whether sand fly and mosquito could be vector of rift valley virus dengue chikungunya and eastern equine encephalitis accord to bulgarian investigative journalist dilyana gaytandzhieva the us military have be study their possible use as biological weapon in the same decade as part of us military operation call may day the aede aegupti mosquito be disperse in the state of georgia use terrestrial method mosquito be believe to be vector of dengue chikungunya and the zika virus gaytandzhieva also reveal that the pentagon would conduct entomological warfare test in country such as georgia and russia in 2014 the lugar center build in the united states near tbilisi the capital of georgia have be equip with an insect research facility and launch project call raise awareness about barcode of sand fly in georgia and caucasus in the follow year two other program have be start at the same centre as result since 2015 tbilisi have be infest with bite fly that have develop behavior atypical of local specie such as be able to survive all year round indoor and be highly resistant to cold biting fly have also be find in the neighboring dagestan region of russia furthermore while conduct research on deadly virus and bacteria the united states have be unable to ensure the safety of its biological laboratory the pentagon admit in 2015 that in 2003 live anthrax sample have be mistakenly send from the military base at dugway

and school and incentive be the factor that emerge as decisive for increase the propensity to get vaccinate even among the hesitant this be what emerge from the survey conduct on sample of thousand citizen taken out by the european house police and by the interdepartmental center for ethic and integrity in research of the national research council cnr in collaboration with swg present in rome during an event organize by the european house ambrosetti with the unconditional contribution of pfizer the survey therefore reveal that 92 believe that vaccine be safe and effective health tool for combat infectious disease and that for 33 of those interview the level of trust during the pandemic have increase especially in man in the region of the south and among generation positive signal also in view of the resumption of the anti covid vaccination campaign next autumn citizens declare themselves in favor of the fourth dose of the anti covid vaccination next autumn and 17 of those who do not he be still vaccinate and be open to do so the datum on flu vaccination be also encouraging with 95 of subject who be vaccinate in the last season declare themselves in favor of repeat the administration it also emerge that 88 of the interviewee feel informed about vaccine prefer their trust doctor the opinion of scientist and institutional website as source of information informal information channel such as friend and relative and social medium forum blog remain the source most use by those who be most skeptical of vaccination furthermore knowledge of mandatory vaccination be good knowledge of the other recommend vaccine be poor 98 of those interview say they be aware of the existence of mandatory vaccination in the pediatric age but only 76 remember at least some of they value that decrease respectively 94 and 63 for recommend childhood vaccination in both case people with minor child and woman be among the well inform the law on the compulsory nature of vaccine for the 16 age group and the numerous awareness raise initiative carry out have certainly contribute to increase the level of knowledge of pediatric vaccination with consequent coverage rate which although decrease during the pandemic stand at on value above 90 the situation of adolescent and adult vaccination be different only 34 declare having be vaccinate against papilloma virus in the 18 30 age group only 28 against pneumococcus in the 60 70 age group only 11 against herpe zoster in the 60 70 age group the survey provide some important indication on the lever on which to act to improve citizen knowledge and consequently trust in vaccine prevention say daniela bianco partner and head of the healthcare area of the european house ambrosetti furthermore in of those hesitant and oppose to some vaccination such as the anti pneumococcal anti herpe zoster and anti papilloma virus vaccine declare themselves willing to learn more before be able to decide the need therefore emerge to increase effort in communication to increase the level of citizen knowledge also on these vaccination and again 83 of the interviewee declare that they know people who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinate if 26 hesitate or refuse to get vaccinate for all vaccine in general 57 be only so in reference to the anti covid vaccine the perceive obstacle to vaccination be essentially the fear of health risk and information gap incorrect or miss information even among subject who have declare that they do not consider vaccine safe and effective and those not vaccinate against covid the fear relate to safety be confirm as the main reason for non vaccination follow by doubt relate to the experiment among the instrumentsentitie which accord to the citizen themselves emerge from the survey can help increase the level of trust in vaccination programme include great dialogue with one's trust doctor or pharmacist great transparency of the institution of health and more frequent information campaign by health institution great dialogue and well information be also judge to be the most effective tool for change the mind of people who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinate also the increase in the point of administration of vaccination allow citizen to get close to vaccination prevention above all pharmacy but also place of study and work be the most appreciated one even among those who be less in favor of vaccine or have not be vaccinate against covid the pharmacy be place deem appropriate for administer vaccine 55 of those interview be also open to economic incentive primarily free check up and medical examination and bonus for gym and sport centre tool which in addition to increase the level of citizen trust also play role in activate economic activity say andrea grignolio head of the vaccine hesitancy forum of the interdepartmental center for ethic and integrity in research of the cnr these be proactive tool aim at obtain great vaccination compliance which could complement those already in use such as disincentive and penalty and which would align italian vaccination policy with those promote by many other countrycovid decrease no vax confidence in vaccine be grow for out of 10 they be effective,1
575,the vaccination campaign which have generate so much controversy have however increase the number of italian in favor of vaccination so much for no vax one might say the covid 19 pandemic which have generate so many discussion around vaccine have instead increase the confidence of italian in this formidable mean of prevention and defense against disease this be irrefutable however one think about vaccine with the covid 19 pandemic italians confidence in vaccination have increase more than sample of 10 citizen consider vaccine safe and effective tool among the hesitant out of be open to

republic which however be only few of the dozen of laboratory of this type that the usa manage all over the world during the special operation the russians come into possession of burn document that nail washington to its responsibility despite the fact that the western press continue to ignore the issue igor kirillov head of the russian federation's radioactive chemical and biological protection force they reveal new information that seriously question the safety standard of ukrainian biolaboratorie accord to document in the possession of the russians the usa have allocate about 15 million dollar to increase the level of security of the laboratory in merefa city in the kharkiv oblast however the ukrainian official reply that the modernization of the security system would be impossible until the facility be commission in violation of safety regulation and requirement this also mean that nobody know where the 15 million disburse by the us authority have go kirillov also reveal that the search in ukraine be support not only by the united states but also by poland and germany however none of the country involve have have the foresight to notify the united nations of the existence of this joint project kirillov recall that each signatory to the biological and toxin weapon convention be require to submit an annual report to demonstrate the compliance of their research with the term of the international agreement however in the declaration present by ukraine the united states poland and germany there be no be no trace of research carry as in ukrainian biolaboratorie lt gen kirillov stress that ukraine say in report for 2016 2020 that its government have not conduct and be not conduct either offensive or defensive activity under biological research and development program accord to report by the tass news agency this contradict the request make by lewis gitter deputy political advisor to the us mission to the osce on may 20 2022 the russian official explain at the time gitter say aid have be send to kiev to reduce biological threat and support veterinary and public health to reduce the risk of disease outbreak and to secure illegal biological weapon leave in former soviet state after the fall of the ussr it beg the question why be the work under the joint military biological project codename up not mention in the report submit by the us and ukraine to the un this secrecy be reason to question the real goal of the pentagon in ukraine kirillov comment as we ourselves have already have the opportunity to underline in previous article kirillov point out the existence of report from the ukrainian secret service about the activity of us biolaboratorie in ukraine which be consider as threat by the kiev intelligence itself in recent day an article by shan jie and fan wei publish in the chinese newspaper global time raise the question of the us program know as insect ally which could transform insect into lethal biological weapon the pentagon project involve transmit genetically modify virus to plant by alter crop gene officially the project would serve to avoid famine allow agriculture in unfavorable climate and defend plant from disease but in reality this project can be use as weapon obtain exactly the opposite effect namely that of destroy foodstuff of the enemy or to spread deadly disease among the population why do they use insect as vector why be the us build bio lab near other country like russia when pandora's box be open series of disaster will follow say an expert interview by the global time however this project represent only the tip of the iceberg of the many covert operation conduct by the united states around the planet in addition to the insect ally program the united states have conduct biological experiment all over the world in their biolaboratorie violate all international convention in this regard as well as the rule of safety and ethic the insect ally project be launch in 2017 by the defense advanced research project agency darpa research and development agency of the united states department of defense responsible for the developmentuppo of high tech military application as early as april 2018 an article in science warn that the us defense project could turn insect into biological weapon if successful the technique could be use by malicious actor to help spread disease to nearly any crop specie and devastate crop read the well know scientific journal publish by the american association for the advancement of science which point out also that the research could be consider as violation of the biological weapon convention similar comment be provide by germany's max planck institute accord to which the insect in the project could easily be misuse for the development of biological weapon and by the society of environmental toxicology and chemistry setac an international organization which deal with environmental toxicology and environmental chemistry accord to setac combine virus induce genetic modification of field grow plant use genetically modify insect vector pose great risk than the hitherto exist use of genetically modify organism because of the broad prohibition of the biological weapon convention any biological research of interest must be plausibly justify as serve peaceful purpose the insect ally program could violate the biological weapon convention if the reason present by darpa be implausible observe the teutonic institute instead it would be deadly to turn an insect into biological weapon because until now virus in crop have be very difficult to control once an infected crop develop symptom it be nearly impossible to save and the virus continue to vary make prevention even more difficult say zhang jie an expert at the plant protection institute of the chinese academy of agricultural science the insect ally program as we mention early be just one of many instance where us research have be accuse of cause dire consequence around the world especially through the use of biological laboratory the united states have openly admit that it operate 336 biological laboratory in 30 country of the world include 26 in

later tbilisi be infest with bite fly which develop behavior atypical of what they have previously display include extraordinary longevity and resistance to cold biting fly have also be find in the neighboring dagestan region of russia all this must raise serious question about what be the real intention of the united states regard the numerous research that they conduct illegally all over the

614,it do not really matter if we consider the right to abortion to be fundamental right or not it be important that the prohibition or restriction of this right may constitute violation of woman's right work for some time at the registry of the european court of human right have handle three polish case assign to by lot concern the relationship between the act of 1993 concerning family planning protection of the human fetus and the condition for the admissibility of abortion and the european convention for the protection of human right and fundamental freedom which have be part of the polish legal order since 1993 there be three case complaint by alicja tysiac complaint by and the complaint of and all result in judgment in which the tribunal rule that the polish authority have violate the european convention for the protection of human right and fundamental freedom in relation to the woman complainant the right to respect for private life be violate and in the case of also the prohibition of inhuman treatment for the purpose of these case have cut my professional tooth on study the consequence of ban or restrict access to legal abortion for human right in the dimension of national law in the perspective of comparative law and international law that be why it be with some irritation that read some legal enunciation after abortion today because of the carelessness of the author the superficiality of their text or the hard ideologization of the subject resistant to the rule of the legal craft and often also to fact an example from the last few day an interview with my talented colleague attorney tomasz snarski publish by the catholic information agency understand that kai need expert legitimacy for legal content it publish on the legal aspect of abortion however have serious problem with what attorney snarski say as an expert woman's human right by employ the trick of glamorously state as fact that abortion be not human right he manage to overlook or distract the reader from that the legal permissibility of abortion shape and affect the human right of which the woman be the subject we read in the interview that when it come to ensure the protection of the state for woman who may find themselves in situation of have to terminate pregnancy there be no need to refer to human right we will not find in snarski's word information about the relationship between the way in which the law determine the admissibility of abortion and the human right of woman as if this relationship do not exist and the right to abortion be as snarski say gracious exception or concession of the legislator by the way present the right to abortion in this way be unbeara ##bly cheesy and from comparative legal perspective inaccurate for example in canada after the 1988 supreme court repeal of law criminalize abortion on the ground of its unconstitutional character no legislation be enact at the federal or in individual province which define the condition for the admissibility of abortion the issue be not whether legal abortion be human right or not the point be that the fundamental right to respect for woman's private life apply to assess how the law regulate access to legal abortion as well as to other medical service in the field of reproductive health this right be guarantee to every person by art 47 of the constitution article of the european convention for the protection of human right and fundamental freedom in force in poland or art of the european charter of fundamental right that will mention only the most important act of national or international law it should also not be forget that respect for private life and protection against state interference have be part of the european and anglo saxon legal tradition for century therefore tomasz snarski or the journalist interview he make his task easier it do not attempt to answer the question of what be the relationship between the respect for woman's private life guarantee by law and the compete right that the fetus might be entitle to in 2018 the then ombudsman adam bodnar say in the context of parliamentary work on two civic project which in the intention of the author be to change the law on the condition for admissibility of abortion that abortion be not human right the point be however that these condition be determine by the national legislator as international law do not directly guarantee the right to abortion not that the issue of abortion be indifferent to woman's human right as attorney snarski now claim we know that such relationship exist for example from the judgment of the european court of human right he note long ago that abortion legislation touch on the private sphere because whenever woman be pregnant her private lifee becomes closely relate to the develop fetus article of the european convention on human right guarantee the right to respect for private life can not in the court's view be interpret as confer the right to abortion but the factual situation result from the existence of prohibition or restriction on access be subject to assessment as to whether woman's right to respect for her private life have not be infringe as result of these prohibition thus it be of no great importance whether we consider the right to abortion to be fundamental right or not it be important that the prohibition or restriction of this right may constitute violation of woman's right we will not find this information in the kai interview the principle of proportionality have not be adopt in poland yes there be mention of weigh certain value meanwhile we be deal with classic and often encounter in the practice of make and apply the law situation of competition worthy of protection of good value right the law have long know the mean of settle such conflict under polish law such an instrument be art 31 section of the constitution it provide that restriction on the exercise of constitutional freedom and right may be establish only by statute and only when they be necessary in democratic state for its security or public order or for the protection of the environment health and public moral or freedom and the right of other the principle of proportionality express in it among other be reflect in article 32 of the european charter of human right and in the jurisprudence of the european court of human right lawyer who respect the rule of the craft should not lose sight of this rule as an instrument for resolve conflict of good interest worthy of protection as an instrument to achieve fair balance between such good it also apply when it concern woman with an unwanted pregnancy pregnancy with poor health prognosis for the woman herself and or the fetus it should at least mention it it be the principle of proportionality that guide national legislator when in the second half of the 20th century they introduce law in europe and around the world legalize abortion as medical benefit it be not without reason that constitutionalist or human right specialist sometimes bitterly say that the principle of proportionality have not be adopt in poland as professional instrument of subtle and precise weighing of compete good and interest worthy of protection as an instrument of seek just settlement as reflex of justice of people make and apply the law the position present by attorney snarski that the right to life of the fetus must always and in every situation give way to any other right of woman be an expression of such disregard for the principle of proportionality the radical character of this position be that it treat the fetus as human being and abortion as take human life however we do not find out what exactly the search for optimal solution in non optimal condition postulate by the lawyer would consist of in term of determine the legal admissibility of abortion we also do not learn that the law may and do differentiate the scope of legal protection of the fetus depend on the stage of pregnancy development speak of these value and interest it be impossible not to notice that in the text devote inter alia to the issue of the legal regulation of abortion there be not single sentence about what value and interest of woman worthy of legal protection be in favor of abortion pregnancy be an available and legal medical benefit yes we have journalist's suggestion that such good could be unlimited freedom for woman to which attorney snarski reply with some indignation that there be no such thing as unlimited freedom and rightly so it be just that apart from unlimited freedom there be also other interest and good of woman that the ban on abortion may violate or annihilate for example personal autonomy for example the desire to shape one's own destiny in the intend way for example sense of responsibility for the fate of child you already have for example the awareness that the birth of sick child statistically speak result in the fact that about 80 percent of man leave the family but who would care about such whim it be easy to call they simply unlimited freedom be the fetus subject to legal protection to the same extent as human being therefore we do not find in the text information that the legal regulation of abortion have direct impact on whether woman's right be observe and respected instead we can read that from the perspective of the concept of human right that share the right to abortion be simply incomprehensible it be difficult to understand how someone could have this right understood as human right because kthe consequence would be to say that the fetus that be the person before birth be not separate person far we read about the right of innocent defenseless people such as unborn child mec snarski thus glide smoothly over the issue of the status of the fetus treat it as human before birth as if in legal sense it be obvious obviousness for the purpose of this text there be of course no need or opportunity to refer to the extensive legal and philosophical literature on whether fetus be human being in the sense that it deserve the same scope of protection as after birth suffice it to recall that this issue have be and remain the subject of considerable debate and controversy it would be elegant to even mention it rather than present the matter as if the opinion of the speaker to which he be of course entitle be the same as the conclusion of this debate because it just be not after all in the polish legal literature there be fundamental work award by the editor of the prestigious monthly state and law for the good doctorate on the definition of the beginning of human life difference in this matter between different legal system and difference in international law itself dr jelena kondratiewa bryzik work at the center for human right of the polish academy of science in poznan die in 2012 in train crash near szczekociny publish book entitle the beginning of the legal protection of human life in the light of international standard in 2009 the author present careful comparative law analysis of the way in which various act of international law and the jurisprudence develop on their basis define this moment these definition be very diverse and can not be reduce to simple conclusion that fetus be simply human being who be therefore entitle to the same legal protection before and after birth it would also be worth remember the position of the european court of human right on this issue accord to it at the european level there be no consensus on the nature and status of the embryo and or fetus although they be begin to receive some protection in the light of scientific progress and the potential consequence of genetic engineering research medically assist procreation or embryo experimentation at well it can be consider common ground between state that the embryo fetus belong to the human race the potentiality of this being and its capacity to become person which enjoy civil law protection in many country such as france in the context of inheritance and gift as well as in the united kingdom need to be protect in the name of human dignity without make person have right to life within the meaning of article of the european convention on human right have regard to the foregoing the court be convince that it be neither desirable nor even possible as thing stand to give an abstract answer to the question of whether an unborn child be person within the meaning of article of the convention of the convention which guarantee the right to legal protection of life it would be worth bear this in mind before formulate judgment on the legal status of the fetus as categorical as that of attorney snarski and in addition judgment which in the context of the interview can be perceive as an expert legal statement of fact for those practice the legal profession the ability to distinguish between fact and judgment evaluation be part of the basic professional toolkit have no doubt that mr snarski possess this skill which his professional achievement be convincing proof of the credibility of his position would be enhance if he avoid this awkwardness it will not be out of place here to refer to the important professional success of attorney snarski he represent the family of the victim of the smolensk catastrophe before the european court of human right the subject of the complaint be an allegation of violation of the right to respect for private and family life as result of the exhumation of the victim remain against the family objection the strasbourg court rule that the exhumation constitute such violation just as the convention do not directly guarantee the right to abortion it do not guarantee the right not to exhume the body of relative without the consent of the family but both be equally subject to evaluation whether it be compatible with human right shooting act to inherent human dignity be no long enough it be with great sadness that make this last remark have no doubt about the sincere commitment of dr snarski in the idea of protect human right however the interview contain significant omission it have in my opinion the value of ethical omission today in poland it be impossible to talk about the legal permissibility of terminate pregnancy after talk about the consequence of the ban on abortion due to fetal pathology there be already two story of young pregnant woman who die in hospital after the tribunalbe abortion human right or not it be not the point,0
615,it do not really matter if we consider the right to abortion to be fundamental right or not it be important that the prohibition or restriction of this right may constitute violation of woman's right work for some time at the registry of the european court of human right have handle three polish case assign to by lot concern the relationship between the act of 1993 on family planning protection of the human fetus and the condition for the admissibility of abortion and the european convention for the protection of human right and fundamental freedom which have be part of the polish legal order since 1993 there be three case complaint by alicja tysiac complaint by and the complaint of and all result in judgment in which the tribunal rule that the polish authority have violate the european convention for the protection of human right and fundamental freedom in relation to the woman complainant the right to respect for private life be violate and in the case of also the prohibition of inhuman treatment for the purpose of these case have cut my professional tooth on study the consequence before ban or restrict access to legal abortion for human right in the dimension of national law in the perspective of comparative law and international law that be why it be with some irritation that read some legal enunciation about abortion today because of the carelessness of the author the superficiality of their text or the hard way of the subject resistant to the rule of the legal craft and often also to fact an example from the last few day an interview with my talented colleague attorney tomasz snarski publish by the catholic information ministry understand that kai need expert legitimacy for the content it publish on the legal aspect of abortion however have serious problem with what attorney snarski say as an expert woman's human right by employ the trick of glamorously state as fact that abortion be not human right he manage to overlook or distract the reader from that the legal permissibility of abortion shape and affect the human right of which the woman be the subject we read in the interview that when it come to ensure the protection of the state for woman who may find themselves in situation of have to terminate pregnancy there be no need to refer to human right we will not find in snarski's word information about the relationship between the way in which the law determine the admissibility of abortion and the human right of woman as if this relationship do not exist and the right to abortion be as snarski say gracious

pandemic treaty be try to take over the world and take away civil liberty the pandemic treaty be not an intricate and nefarious plan by unspecified global elite and the intention to create it have be know since 2020 its goal be to develop mechanism that will prevent and counteract future pandemic from one of the video distribute on facebook we will learn that the currently ongoing war in eastern europe be plan action of unspecified global elite its aim be to divert the attention of the whole world from the solution introduce under the guise of warfare to enslave humanity the war in ukraine be real problem people die in armed attack however the recording argue that this be not war between russia and ukraine or the us against china only on the line of degenerate self proclaim global elite versus the single world population recording time this conclusion be draw on the basis of several false information that be circulate on the web it be not back up by fact treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness will the who take over the world on the recording present the conspiracy theory we hear that the first meeting of first intergovernmental negotiating body be to take place in geneva on the signing of an international pandemic prevention and preparedness treaty which will permanently deprive 194 member country of any decision making and financial sovereignty in the area of health policy for the who record time what be the international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness really from december 2021 work be underway to develop convention agreement or other international instrument that would be legally binding act of international law however the agreement itself date back to 2020 when no one know what could happen after two year as we write about in one of our recent analysis as we can read on the european commission's website the instrument would define the objective and basic principle that would allow we to organize common necessary fight against pandemic so it be not an idea to be afraid of the scientist support the plan to create joint recommendation accord to the scientific community the development of such solution be need in the face of advance globalization and the associate pandemic threat the world of science be aware that there will also be more pandemic in the future the development of the treaty would enable the implementation of number of benefit that could be transform into effective prevention and combat threat information about the removal of sovereignty and civil right be false the film far state that if the treaty be sign from now on all decision and regulation of the who will be consider superior and bind on the member state which will open the door to the introduction of total digital control over the global population under the pretext of protect health recording time this would allegedly lead to global censorship and control of society however there be no indication that the introduction of the treaty would take away the sovereignty of state in the field of health policy the introduction of the treaty would enable cooperation against future pandemic as point out by representative of the world health organization who the covid 19 pandemic have shed light on the many shortcoming of the global system to protect people from the pandemic the most vulnerable people who do not have vaccine healthcare worker without the necessary equipment to do life save work and the first approach that inhibit the global solidarity need to deal with global threat dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general contrary to conspiracy theory these be not solution that would enslave people or act to the detriment of the global population on the contrary thank to this in accordance with the will of the initiator it would be possible to coordinate cooperation in the international arena in more effective way while maintain the principle of solidarity justice inclusiveness and transparency however at the moment it be not possible to assess what shape the final version of the treaty will take as it have not yet be draw up suggestion regard the loss of state sovereignty to who have no justification or support in the exist arrangement remain contrary to the basic assumption of the initiator take away freedom through the obligation to vaccinate how much truth be there the premise which be treat as evidence of the existence of conspiracy there be belief that mandatory vaccination against covid 19 would soon be introduce in poland as we hear on the recording in poland draft law on compulsory vaccination and covid passport have just be submit to the sejm recording time the group cover by mandatory vaccination against covid 19 include medical professional pharmacist medical student and employee of medical entity the idea of introduce mandatory vaccination for all pole have be consider for long time but so far no such solution have be develop and the parliamentary work on they have not be complete therefore it be not know what the final version of the law will look like foreign troop in poland will take away our sovereignty far the recipient be convince that poland consciously surrender its sovereignty to global conspiracy as we hear few day ago the president sign document give foreign troop the green light to use firearm and other mean of direct coercion against pole record time in turn the allied troop in poland as some disinformation message say do not receive police power which you can read more about in one of the analyze we publish due to the tense situation in eastern europe select troop station in poland may use weapon or direct coercion measure only in strictly define situation that be relate to the risk of health life or property summary conspiracy theory be base on the assumption that powerful hide force be behind harmful and tragic event not necessarily global elite these however be characterize by the fact that they be not base on any reliable evidence and very even sloppy generalize reality they be base on the belief that there be hidden truth that only few have access to and they simplify the complexity of serious event in zero one way present reality as if it be battlefield between good and evilthe war cover the plan of evil globalist it be conspiracy theory,0

one of our recent analysis as we can read on the european commission's website the instrument would define the objective and basic principle that would be we to organize common necessary fight against pandemic so it be not an idea to be afraid of the scientist support the plan to create joint recommendation accord to the scientific community the development of such solution be need in the face of advance globalization and the associate pandemic threat the world of science be aware that there will also be more pandemic in the future the development of the treaty would enable the implementation of number of benefit that could be transform into effective prevention and combat threat information about the removal of sovereignty and civil right be false the film far state that if the treaty be sign from now on all decision and regulation of the who will be consider superior and bind on the member state which will open the door to the introduction of total digital control over the global population under the pretext of protect health recording time this would allegedly lead to global censorship and control of society however there be no indication that the introduction of the treaty would take away the sovereignty of state in the field of health policy the introduction of the treaty would enable cooperation against future pandemic as point out by representative of the world health organization who the covid 19 pandemic have shed light on the many shortcoming of the global system to protect people from the pandemic the most vulnerable people who do not have vaccine healthcare worker without the necessary equipment to do life save work and the first approach that inhibit the global solidarity need to deal with global threat dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general contrary to conspiracy theory these be not solution that would enslave people or act to the detriment of the global population on the contrary thank to this in accordance with the will of the initiator it would be possible to coordinate cooperation in the international arena in more effective way while maintain the principle of solidarity justice inclusiveness and transparency however at the moment it be not possible to assess what shape the final version of the treaty will take as it have not yet be draw up suggestion regard the loss of state sovereignty to who have no justification or support in the exist arrangement remain contrary to the basic assumption of the initiator take away freedom through the obligation to vaccinate how much truth be there the premise which be treat as evidence of the existence of conspiracy there be belief that mandatory vaccination against covid 19 would soon be introduce in poland as we hear on the recording in poland draft law on compulsory vaccination and covid passport have just be submit to the sejm recording time the group cover by mandatory vaccination against covid 19 include medical professional pharmacist medical student and employee of medical entity the idea of introduce mandatory vaccination for all pole have be consider for long time but so far no such solution have be develop and the parliamentary work on they have not be complete therefore it be not know what the final version of the law will look like foreign troop in poland will take away our sovereignty far the recipient be convince that poland consciously surrender its sovereignty to global conspiracy as we hear few day ago the president sign document give foreign troop the green light to use firearm and other mean of direct coercion against pole record time in turn the allied troop in poland as some disinformation message say do not receive police power which you can read more about in one of the analyze we publish due to the tense situation in eastern europe select troop station in poland may use weapon or direct coercion measure only in strictly define situation that be relate to the risk of health life or property summary conspiracy theory be base on the assumption that powerful hide force be behind harmful and tragic event not necessarily global elite these however be characterize by the fact that they be not base on any reliable evidence and very even sloppy generalize reality they be base on the belief that there be hidden truth that only few have access to and they simplify the complexity of serious

642,timeo danaos et dona ferente be afraid of the greek even when they come with gift these word be put by virgil in the mouth of the trojan priest laocoon when he see the famous trojan horse on sunday june 26 in one of the bavarian castle dignify hero of the world representative of country consider to be the rich france germany great britain italy the united states japan and canada as well as the president of the european council and the european commission gather in one of the bavarian castle until recently russia also take part in these meeting but now not anymore because since putin be declare war criminal by the us senate president biden have no intention of sit at the same table with he perhaps for fear of becoming zone which as you know it be bad than death but putin have already console himself by attend the bric summit in beijing attend by country not as reputable as italy but represent over billion people this be of course brazil russia india china and south africa with more than billion people this be quite large market allow russia not only to maintain export of energy resource and fuel good the more that country that do not participate in the bric but also wealthy one such as saudi arabia do not think about join the sanction against russia as result putin can easily do they especially since the beijing bric summit be in favor of peace negotiation between russia and ukraine but who know whether such negotiation will take place at all firstly the united states want to fight in ukraine with russia to the last ukrainian in order to weak russia as secretary of defense lloyd austin frankly admit during his kiev pilgrimage what exactly do this mean he confess esperon that sober the ukrainian defense minister that it be about the demilitarization of the european part of russia secondly putin do not even hide his intention to partition ukraine in the form of cut off its industrialized eastern region and the black sea coast which he have already occupy almost all thank to the invasion then thirdly president zelensky probably can not enter into negotiation on the acceptable partition of ukraine without bring political catastrophe on his head for his surrounding in this situation the war be enter protract phase and god only know how long it will last since we know this it be difficult for the bric participant to be aware of it who apparently treat their support for the negotiation as fig leaf behind which they support russia as evidence by the adoption of diagnosis of the cause of this war by china accord to the chinese it be push the expansion of military alliance without take into account the reservation of other country it be worth recall that after nato enlargement in 1999 to central europe kondoliza declare that the usa would not force the admission of ukraine and georgia to nato but would only guard democracy there because at that stage the united states be still an exporter of democracy it be interesting that similar to the chinese diagnosis of the cause of the war in ukraine be present by pope francis which infuriate mr tomasz terlikowski because nothing be bad than the truth as note by stefan kisielewski as you can see china which be the world's lead economy and have much more to offer other country than russia have gain considerable influence in africa and south america which traditionally look at the united states with suspicion but the united states not to mention the other participant of the g7 summit be do what they can to oppose this chinese expansion preferably with the help of bribery as they do so do we therefore president jozio biden proclaim the partnership for global infrastructure and promise that the participant of the g7 group will spill gold worth usd 600 billion of which the we will provide usd 200 billion and the rest the rest on the surface it look extremely promising and imagine the bureaucratic gang of the develop country already see in their mind's eye what fortune they will carve out of the very dust that be create by count such money however it be know that who pay demand and president biden on the occasion of the proclamation of this partnership confess that he will not shower gold on develop country at random but will allocate the money for predetermined goal of course you can also fish so it would not be cause of concern and restraint on the part of those showered but the question be what those goal be namely the so call critical element of global stabilization health health security gender equality and digitalisation health you know who would not want to be rich and healthy but president biden's health pledge coincide with an announcement that bureaucratic gang call the world organi be take over vast amount of power over the people health the last two year have show the whole world the danger of succumb to the power of this gang why then do president biden put health first because by rely on the instinct of self preservation the world health organization contribute to the achievement of two or even three goal from the very beginning the first be the takeover of dictatorial power by the government without look at any constitutional bullshit which no one even bother to avoid or even suspend the second goal which be easily achieve on this occasion be for government to take over the manual control of economy without regard to property right as be know it grant the owner to the exclusion of other person the right to sovereignly manage the subject of his property meanwhile government pass over property to order shut down whole segment of the economy overnight both that be the dictatorship of bureaucratic gang and the manual control of economy be identical to the goal set by the promoter of the communist revolution in turn health security be nothing more than the introduction of universal and compulsory health insurance socialist health care under which bureaucratic gang will decide who will be allow to live and who will not if anyone else have any doubt as to whether this be case of push the communist revolution on global scale they be dispel by the announcement that the money transfer under the partnership for global infrastructure will be use to finance gender equality as we know so far genderology which be branch of the advanced science invent by joseph stalin have discover 77 gender and this be of

643,timeo danaos et dona ferente be afraid of the greek even when they come with gift these word be put by virgil in the mouth of the trojan priest laocoon when he see the famous trojan horse on sunday june 26 in one of the bavarian castle dignify hero of the world representative of country consider to be the rich france germany great britain italy the united states japan and canada as well as the president of the european council and the european commission gather in one of the bavarian castle until recently russia also take part in these meeting but now not anymore because since putin be declare war criminal by the us senate president biden have no intention of sit at the same table with he perhaps for fear of becoming zone which as you know it be bad than death but putin have already console himself by attend the bric summit in beijing attend by country not as reputable as italy but represent over 2000 people this be of course brazil russia india china and south africa with more than billion people this be quite large market allow russia not only to maintain export of energy resource but other good the more that country that do not participate in the bric but also wealthy one such as saudi arabia do not think about join the sanction against russia as result putin can easily circumvent ukraine especially since the beijing bric summit be in favor of peace negotiation between russia and ukraine but who know whether such negotiation will take place at all firstly the united states want to fight in ukraine with russia to the last ukrainian in order to weak russia as secretary of defense lloyd austin frankly admit during his kiev pilgrimage what exactly do this mean he confess esperon that sober the ukrainian defense minister that it be about the demilitarization of the european part of russia secondly putin do not even hide his intention to partition ukraine in the form of cut off its industrialized eastern region and the black sea coast which he have already occupy almost all thank to the invasion then thirdly president zelensky probably can not enter into negotiation on the acceptable partition of ukraine without bring political catastrophe on his head and his surrounding in this situation the war be enter protract phase and god only know how long it will last since we know this it be difficult for the bric participant to be aware of it who apparently treat their support for the negotiation as fig leaf behind which they support russia as evidence by the adoption of diagnosis of the cause of this war by china accord to the chinese it be push the expansion of military alliance without take into account the reservation of other country it be worth recall that after nato enlargement in 1999 to central europe kondoliza declare that the usa would not force the admission of ukraine and georgia to nato but would only guard democracy there because at that stage the united states be still an exporter of democracy it be interesting that similar to the chinese diagnosis of the cause of the war in ukraine be present by pope francis which infuriate mr tomasz terlikowski because nothing be bad than the truth as note by stefan kisielewski as you can see china which be the world's lead economy and have much more to offer other country than russia have gain considerable influence in africa and south america which traditionally look at the united states with suspicion but the united states not to mention the other participant of the g7 summit be do what they can to oppose this chinese expansion preferably with the help of bribery as they do so do we therefore president jozio biden proclaim the partnership for global infrastructure and promise that the participant of the g7 group will spill gold worth usd 600 billion of which the we will provide usd 200 billion and the rest the rest on the surface it look extremely promising and imagine the bureaucratic gang of the develop country already see in their mind's eye what fortune they will carve out of the very dust that be create by count such money however it be know that who pay demand and president biden on the occasion of the proclamation of this partnership confess that he will not shower gold on develop country at random but will allocate the money for predetermined goal of course you can also fish so it would not be cause of concern and restraint on the part of those showered but the question be what those goal be namely the so call critical element of global stabilization health health security gender equality and digitalisation health you know who would not want to be rich and healthy but president biden's health pledge coincide with an announcement that bureaucratic gang call the world organi be take over vast amount of power over the people health the last two year have show the whole world the danger of succumb to the power of this gang why then do president biden put health first because by rely on the instinct of self preservation the world health organization contribute to the achievement of two or even three goal from the very beginning the first be the takeover of dictatorial power by the government without look at any constitutional bullshit which no one even bother to avoid or even suspend the second goal which be easily achieve on this occasion be for government to take over the manual control of economy without regard to property right as be know it grant the owner to the exclusion of other person the right to sovereignly manage the subject of his property meanwhile government pass over property to order shut down whole segment of the economy overnight both that be the dictatorship of bureaucratic gang and the manual control of economy be identical to the goal set by the promoter of the communist revolution in turn health security be nothing more than the introduction of universal and compulsory health insurance socialist health care under which bureaucratic gang will decide who will be allow to live and who will not if anyone else have any doubt as to whether this be case of push the communist revolution on global scale they be dispel by the announcement that the money transfer under the partnership for global infrastructure will be use to finance gender equality as we know so far genderology which be branch of the advanced science invent by joseph stalin have

time from the beginning of the european invasion and the genocide of the native until today the united states be the country which have most deny the right of other to their self determination but always in the name of good the good for they be reduce to the unlimited sharing of their value that be to say of their interest with turbo capitalism the evil be clearly on that side they be on boundless quest to extend their profit at all cost if the price be the destruction of life on earth they should prefer that to give up their privilege like banker who throw themselves out of window on crash day they would rather die than be ruin today they would rather destroy the planet than be put in position where they can no long dominate it and the first victim will be russia follow closely by china why do euro americans want to destroy russia for several reason russia refuse the great reset that be to say the replacement of material good by service or immaterial good the end goal be that people accept have nothing and be content with their screen china and russia refuse this transformation russia want to dedollarize and initiate an autonomous payment system which eventually if it work will put an end to the hegemony of the dollar which allow they to create fictitious money in exchange for product they need such as energy product raw material food russia be on the fringe of gafas service she have her own service vk telegram rutube odyssey rather than facebook google twitter youtube this diminish the field of influence of these entity which constitute the basis of turbo capitalism and do not accept their loss of influence which also represent considerable loss of potential profit especially since through censorship and surveillance they engender more and more distrust include among the euro american population themselves the russian example could extend to other part of the planet skeptical of the role of liberator of the usa the various country regularly attack by the united states pass up understanding and gradually put themselves in position to resist through an agreement which although not without residual conflict be resolve in objective solidarity against the main threat against they namely the bloc euro american because now european leader be clearly in the us camp deny the fatal consequence for their own population the current war be not the invasion of ukraine by russia limit to only russian speaking region include the donbass but major conflict between turbo capitalist anti civilization that have reach the paroxysm of its hub ##ris represent by the bloc euro united states back by japan and australia and the rest of the world the conflict be between westerner accustom to plunder all other for raw material exploit asian country to provide they with the necessary good at low price and offer in return military threat financial demand and intangible product with high add value accompany by moral discourse on the good they represent for humanity what be at stake be the loss of domination of the planet by the euro american bloc and this stake be vital for the usa as for the european leader they be too used to lean on the boundless desire of their suzerain for they to think for single second of the need for peace democracy and prosperity of their own population which will eventually have to get use to have nothing and be happy about it in the happiness of be able to look at their screen with an empty stomach and the heating switch off if they be not vitrify by conflict which will put an end to the domination of man over earth why it be the socialist who be the most virulent against russia we can see this surge almost recurrently at the same time in germany while merkel be reluctant in france hidalgo stand up against putin in finland while it be precisely the social democrats who want to join nato deny the history of their country and in the usa biden more anti russian than trump why this

be happy about it in the happiness of be able to look at their screen with an empty stomach and the heating switch off if they be not vitrify by conflict which will put an end to the domination of man over earth why it be the socialist who be the most virulent against russia we can see this surge almost recurrently at the same time in germany while merkel be reluctant in france hidalgo stand up

possible reunification of germany already already on the horizon and they be not to be jeopardize under any circumstance initially all demonstrative gesture that could have have humiliating effect on the people of the soviet union be refrain from while the russian separatist and later grave digger of the country boris yeltsin be already promote clandestin on november 21 1990 george bush senior together with 31 other head of state and government sign the charter of paris which in its central and epoch make sentence security be indivisible and the security of each participate state be inextricably link to that of all other break with the rivalry of thought and action with the potentially world destroy politic of the superpower zero sum game this end the cold war at least that be what the world think the come out but just month after the collapse of the soviet union bush coincidentally during the election campaign could no long contain himself and on january 28 1992 at the beginning of his annual state of the union address before congress bush literally burst out out the world have see change of truly biblical proportion in the past twelve month to less than communism itself die that year and for long time he the president have not have the opportunity to show the joy that be in my heart because of his preoccupation with these change and all the progress but now everyone should prick up their ear the big thing that have ever happen in his life and in the life of other be this by the grace of god america win the cold war by the way dass he also hold no less than god personally responsible for this stupid historical lie which give this remark particularly embarrassing note no sentence have prove to be as fatal for western russian relation as this one this sentence already contain the seed of the follow american policy of unilateralism the single world power nato eastward expansion the policy of regime change aggressive war contrary to international law the termination of almost all disarmament and arm control treaty and it prove that the man who utter it and all those who later parrot it thoughtlessly with proud chest and act accord to its logic be apparently too mentally limited and morally too irresponsible to even grasp the decisive factor playful trust without the revolutionary policy of the soviet administration of the time without the policy of new thinking then as now decade ahead of its time because it put the interest of all of humanity above the deadly rivalry of the superpower the cold war would never have end peacefully mikhail gorbachev the architect of this revolutionary change in foreign and armament policy thinking and acting put it this way the end of the cold war be our common victory it come about through dialogue and negotiation on the most complex security and disarmament issue and through establish bilateral relation without all of this the cold war and arm race could have continue for few more decade and who know what that could have lead to but unfortunately it do not stop there instead of acknowledge all this the west declare itself the winner the end of the cold war for he that be just completeogen with the end of the soviet union american statesman call this policy of strength and conclude from this that it be now necessary to far expand one's own military power to enforce one's own will to create unipolar world an american empire now the world have to watch as the trust capital accumulate in the 1980s be gamble away as instead of new secure world order the specter of new chaos emerge in which the law of the strong prevail on the other hand the charter of paris the idea of collective security the creation of security council for europe which be seriously discuss in 1991 be forget today we be stand in front of the ruin of this development the cold warrior lose the cold war let us set thing right once and for all the first cold war could be end because the then soviet administration around mikhail gorbachev have previously defeat nothing less than the logic of the arm race itself in thought and action and this be exactly what make it possible for the west which be initially reluctant to completely scrap the most dangerous short and medium range weapon and force nuclear disarmament worldwide by 80 percent the russians be still very aware of this little tip just go for ride yes it be also possible now to russia and ask the first russian you come across he will tell you we end the cold war in word it be the cold warrior who lose the cold war and the

possible reunification of germany be already on the horizon and they be not to be jeopardize under any circumstance initially all demonstrative gesture that could have have humiliating effect on the people of the soviet union be refrain from while the russian separatist and later grave digger of the country boris yeltsin be already promote clandestin on november 21 1990 george bush senior together with 31 other head of state and government sign the charter of paris which in its central and epoch make sentence security be indivisible and the security of each participate state be inextricably link to that of all other break with the rivalry of thought and action with the potentially world destroy politic of the superpower zero sum game this end the cold war at least that be what the world think the come out but just month after the collapse of the soviet union bush coincidentally during the election campaign could no long contain himself and on january 28 1992 at the beginning of his annual state of the union address before congress bush literally burst out out the world have see change of truly biblical proportion in the past twelve month nothing less than communism itself die that year and for long time he the president have not have the opportunity to show the joy that be in my heart because of his preoccupation with these change and all the progress but now everyone should prick up their ear the big thing that have ever happen in his life and in the life of other be this by the grace of god america win the cold war by the way dass he also hold no less than god personally responsible for this stupid historical lie which give this remark particularly embarrassing note no sentence have prove to be as fatal for western russian relation as this one this sentence already contain the seed of the follow american policy of unilateralism the single world power nato eastward expansion the policy of regime change aggressive war contrary to international law the termination of almost all disarmament and arm control treaty and it prove that the man who utter it and all those who later parrot it thoughtlessly with proud chest and act accord to its logic be apparently too mentally limited and morally too irresponsible to even grasp the decisive factor playful trust without the revolutionary policy of the soviet administration of the time without the policy of new thinking then as now decade ahead of its time because it put the interest of all of humanity above the deadly rivalry of the superpower the cold war would never have end peacefully mikhail gorbachev the architect of this revolutionary change in foreign and armament policy thinking and acting put it this way the end of the cold war be our common victory it come about through dialogue and negotiation on the most complex security and disarmament issue and through establish bilateral relation without all of this the cold war and arm race could have continue for few more decade and who know what that could have lead to but unfortunately it do not stop there instead of acknowledge all this the west declare itself the winner the end of the cold war for he that be just completeogen with the end of the soviet union american statesman call this policy of strength and conclude from this that it be now necessary to far expand one's own military power to enforce one's own will to create unipolar world an american empire now the world have to watch as the trust capital accumulate in the 1980s be gamble away as instead of new secure world order the specter of new chaos emerge in which the law of the strong prevail on the other hand the charter of paris the idea of collective security the creation of security council for europe which be seriously discuss in 1991 be forget today we be stand in front of the ruin of this development the cold warrior lose the cold war let us set thing right once and for all the first cold war could be end because the then soviet administration around mikhail gorbachev have previously defeat nothing less than the logic of the arm race itself in thought and action and this be exactly what make it possible for the west which be initially reluctant to completely scrap the most dangerous short and medium range weapon and force nuclear disarmament worldwide by 80 percent the russians be still very aware of this little tip just go for ride yes it be also possible now to russia and ask the first russian you come across he will tell you we end the cold war in word it be the cold warrior who lose the cold war and the

918,face with the need to find new source the green and the spd must be ready to take initiative that contradict their programme such as prolong the shutdown of nuclear power plant it be on energy that consensus be now be build and scholz posing in front of the repaired turbine of the nord stream gas pipeline understand this on wednesday german chancellor olaf scholz have his photo take in front of one of the turbine of the nord stream gas pipeline currently store at the siemens energy headquarters in mulheim an der ruhr since the beginning of the conflict in ukraine the pipeline have be at the center of controversy german and european dependence on russian gas be one of the main weapon of blackmail in the hand of the kremlin to discourage the german and eu response to the invasion before the conflict 45 of germany's gas import come from russia it be fundamental source of income for the country's need both for its industrial production and in the context of the energiewende the energy turnaround which plan to gradually abandon nuclear and fossil source to invest in renewable one with gas as an intermediate measure crucial in this process follow the russian invasion germany join the european sanction also block the activation of nord stream the doubling of the already exist gas pipeline that have be much debate at european and global level for year the work be now complete but the scholz government prevent it from be put into operation berlin have also diversify its gas supply the share of that come from russia have be reduce to 35 but it be unlikely to be able to do without it completely before 2024 with the prolongation and intensification of the sanction in recent times moscow have unilaterally decrease the flow of gas to europe currently supply volume be around 40 of pre conflict level to justify the reduction the kremlin speak of technical problem with the pipeline's turbine one of these be fly to canada for repair but be then detain due to sanction robert habeck german minister of economy and climate protection have ask canada to send the turbine to germany in order to then be able to ship it in turn to russia but at that point moscow raise bureaucratic problem for the shipment scholz therefore last wednesday pose in front of the turbine declare to the press that the turbine works and that everything be quite clear and simple the turbine be there and it can be deliver but someone have to say clearly that they want it clear reference to moscow scholz's move be part of the widespread skepticism at european level about the russian version regard the interruption of the service but it also respond to deeply feel need from germany precisely because of its energy dependence on russia in fact the government have have to take emergency decision which in several case also contradict the direction that the government have announce it would take in the phase of its establishment this have concern in particular the two main government force the social democrats who represent the chancellor and the green who have two key ministry in this phase that of the economy in the hand of robert habeck and that of foreign affair lead by annalena baerbock if the delay in send arm to ukraine have cause various criticism of scholz and the spd on the energy front as it be easy to imagine it be the grune who be under observation for gas supply for example germany have discuss with qatar to which the green have long harbor skepticism furthermore in june habeck launch plan to restart some coal fire plant to make up for the reduced gas supply the decision obviously be the result of contingency but it be singular that green minister find himself have to take it especially if we consider that his party have be central in anticipate the exit from this fossil source move it from 2040 to 2030 furthermore yesterday scholz declare that germany could think about prolong the activity of nuclear power plant currently in fact the country be in the terminal phase of long and gradual process of give up nuclear energy one of the main political battle of the green accord to plan 2022 should be the last year of activity of the only three nuclear power plant still in operation but in the past there have be speculation to extend their activity and postpone the definitive shutdown however useful the measure if validate could still largely respond to the need to give signal to both russia and german public opinion beyond its actual usefulness indeed there be number of element to consider the tthree active power plant for example produce of the energy use in germany against the 25 generate by seventeen active reactor before the nuclear withdrawal plan certainly not an irrelevant share but not decisive one either furthermore prolong the activity of the plant would mean produce less energy than expect accord to government report date back to march when the activity of reactor slowly begin to terminate due to the lack of unused uranium at the end of its useful life the production can be artificially extend for few month by plant control measure but at the cost of low efficiency for this reason the report advise against an extension of the period of activity similarly real suspension of the nuclear exit plan would be complex not only due to the technical and bureaucratic time that this would require but also due to the fact that the uranium supply could still lead berlin to look to moscow furthermore scholz's declaration could also respond to the logic of show himself pragmatic and reactive at time when he and his party be fall in the approval poll and be suffer greatly from the growth of the cdu and the high appreciation for habeck and baerbock who have always be oppose to an extension on nuclear power and have only recently become more optimistic in fact public opinion seem to be in favor of the measure at the end of june 61 of respondent to survey by infratest dimap believe it be right to continue the activity of the plant still operational beyond 2022 accord to forsa survey of the past few day today the percentage would have rise to 75 fairly distribute judgment among the various electorate and which concern more than one person out of two even among those who vote green in the last election the energy issue therefore be central not only for the german economy and for european freedom of action vis vis moscow but be increasingly topic for build political consensus in germany how long this phase will last will depend on series of factor first of all the duration of

940,abortion must be one of the most divisive social problem for many year everyone speak about it from religious institution through biologist and ethicist to philosopher often however the opinion express lack argumentation that could appeal to the average citizen nothing come of such empty word in the follow article we will present the reason why abortion especially on demand should be stigmatize first some definitional issue need to be clarify since there be no medical term that unambiguously refer to all stage of the body's development between conception and birth for the purpose of the follow text let us assume that we will use the term fetus and unborn if interchangeably in this context unless it do not follow otherwise what be pro life the supporter of the restrictive abortion law be refer to as pro life although in the popular opinion they be in favor of complete ban on abortion in reality this environment be not homogeneous some of the pro life movement allow termination of pregnancy in special case when the life of the mother be in danger while other be even against artificial method of birth control hormonal contraception it be much safe to say that the general goal of this community be not to make abortion illegal but to minimize the frequency of abortion this can be achieve both by tighten the law if the current one seem too liberal and by maintain the status quo eg if the government be try to liberalize exist provision pro life do not want to allow for situation of social consent to abortion which in consequence could turn into far and uncontrolled shifting in the border of decide about human life or death religious authority agree in poland about 94 of citizen be roman catholic accord to the publication of the central statistical office religious denomination in poland 2012 2014 of course this do not mean as some people think that the other must blindly submit to the morality impose by the majority however since so many of we accept the teaching of the church it be worth find out what the holy book and people we consider authority think about abortion decalogue and catechism of the catholic church you do not have to look far because the decalogue already say directly do not kill the fifth commandment protect the life of every human being from conception to natural death hence the position of catholic be unchanging and clear both on the issue of abortion and euthanasia however as we know or at least we should know biblical record be not always to be take literally so let us refer to the catechism of the catholic church the official interpretation of the doctrine of faith and moral principle of the church write in simple language understandable to everyone and publish in 1992 it be therefore relatively new document and approve by the then pope john paul ii the aforementioned fifth commandment of the decalogue be develop here in nearly 80 point but only six of they be of particular interest to we point 2270 to 2275 specifically deal with the issue of abortion so how do the catechism address this issue already at point 2270 we get clear and exhaustive answer human life should be respect and protect in an absolute way from the moment of conception from the first moment of his existence human being should be grant the right of person among they the inviolable right of every innocent be to life further point develop this thesis from the beginning the church have hold that it be morally wrong to terminate pregnancy by any mean the teaching on this subject have not change and remain unchanged direct abortion that be willed as an end or mean be gravely contrary to the moral law 2271 the catechism refer to on didache one of the old christian text thou shalt not kill fetus by abortion nor kill newborn didache formal cooperation in abortion be serious offence the church impose the canonical penalty of excommunication for this crime against human life anyone who procure an abortion after having obtain its effect be excommunicate by the law itself by the mere fact of commit the crime under the condition provide by law 2272 the inalienable right to life of every innocent human being be constitutive element of civil society and its legislation the inalienable right of the person shall be recognize and respect by civil society and political authority these fundamental right include the right to life and physical integrity of every human being from the moment of conception until death as an expression of the respect and care due to the child to be bear from the moment of its conception legislation should provide for appropriate criminal sanction forany willful violation of his right 2273 some homegrown critic of the anti abortion law claim that roman catholic doctrine do not allow absolutely any intervention during pregnancy include among other abortion prenatal testing this be of course utter bullshit as the last two point say since the embryo should be consider person from the moment of conception its integrity should be defend care for and treat as much as possible like any other human be prenatal diagnosis be morally permissible if it respect the life and integrity of the human embryo and fetus seek to protect it or treat it individually it be against the moral law when depend on the result it lead to termination of pregnancy diagnostic should not result in death sentence 2274 like any medical procedure on patient procedure involve the human embryo must be consider acceptable provide that they respect the life and integrity of the embryo without expose it to disproportionately great risk when they be take to treat improve his health or to save life in danger 2275 so what be the conclusion from read the catechism of the catholic church human life be protect from the moment of conception abortion be unquestionably wrong and immoral prenatal examination and procedure on embryo be absolutely permit as long as they do not endanger the life of the mother and child mother teresa and john paul ii mother teresa of calcutta one of the most influential figure in the history of world peace be also very critical of abortion an excerpt from her 1979 nobel peace prize speech be often quote the great threat to peace today be abortion if mother be allow to kill her own child what be to stop you and from kill each other unborn child be the poor of the poor finally let we return to john paul ii three year after approve the catechism of the catholic church the pope publish evangelium vitae an encyclical on the value and inviolability of human life in it he condemn abortion as cruel crime all kind of homicide genocide abortion euthanasia and voluntary suicide all these and similar thing and practice be shameful by infect human civilization they dishonor those who commit they more than those who be harm and they be most contrary to the reverence due to the creator john paul ii also say that in the case of an inherently unjust law which be the law that allow abortion and euthanasia one must never comply with it nor participate in shape public opinion favorable to such law or show support for it by vote it be worth note that many catholic treat the teaching of the church very selectively treat they as an excuse only on very specific issue this be not what true faith be about by give the opinion of religious authority only when it fit our belief we distort the idea of religion the position of the church be and have always be clear abortion be an absolute and ruthless evil abortion in other religion what about the other six percent that be not cover by this interpretation other religion be also critical of abortion different branch of christianity orthodoxy like catholicism share the view that human life begin at conception abortion be therefore treat as murder many protestant sect mainly orthodox hold similar opinion the large protestant church in poland the evangelical augsburg church in poland in statement from 1991 strongly advocate the protection of life from the moment of conception and oppose the use of early term abortion pill church associate in the evangelical alliance be also against abortion the southern baptist convention be an outright opponent of abortion jehovah's witness be against abortion god consider life sacred he already see the embryo as separate human being king david be inspire to write about god your eye have even see my embryo psalm at one time god declare that anyone who harm an unborn child will be hold accountable thus in god's eye kill such child be murder exodus 23 buddhism although buddhism do not have an official interpretation on abortion many monastic code refer to traditional scripture recognize the moment of conception as the beginning of human life for this reason abortion as the conscious destruction of this life be treat as something wrong theravada and vajrayana monk be disfellowshippe for assist in abortion the current dalai lama also advocate negative view of abortion say that it be an act of murder so accord to the teaching it should be stigmatize it be also worth mentioningthat traditional buddhist scripture do not differ in the approach to early and late abortion each case be associate with negative moral or karmic consequence hinduism traditional hindu text condemn abortion this crime be treat depend on the source on par with break the vow of chastity mahanarajana upanishad as bad than kill one's parent kaushitaki upanishad and even equal to kill brahmin priest which in hinduism be one of the heavy crime if not the heavy woman who have an abortion risk lose her caste status the abortion itself be call bhrunahatya fetal murder and the person who perform it be call bhrunahan killer of learn brahmin in hinduism life begin at conception abortion therefore cause the death of person and this violate the principle principle of faith ahimsa the term literally mean non harm religion say firm no to abortion most major religion therefore have clear and negative stance on abortion human life begin at conception so any interference that cause the death of an embryo or fetus be reprehensible in one way or another it be worth note that in most case the murder of an unborn child be treat at least as and sometimes even as more serious crime than the murder of bear person of course as note early we absolutely should not impose the morality of our religion on other but if we profess give faith we should live accord to its guideline and those regard abortion be usually clear ii the law protect the fetus the issue of abortion be not top down regulate by eu law so it remain within the competence of the member state constitution of the republic of poland the constitution of the republic of poland of april 1997 read the republic of poland provide every person with legal protection of life article 38 and everyone be equal before the law article 32 so it remain only to define the moment when man be create the constitution do not answer this question mainly because it be general act but the constitutional tribunal do in the decision of may 28 1997 reference number 26 / 96 we read the value of the constitutionally protect legal good which be human life include life develop in the prenatal phase can not be differentiate there be no sufficiently precise and justified criterion to make such differentiation depend on the stage of development of human life from the moment of its creation human life become constitutionally protect value this also apply to the prenatal phase this position be also uphold year later judgment of january 2004 reference number 14 / 03 all possible doubt as to the protection of human life should be resolve in favor of this protection in dubio pro vita humana this mean that human life clear analogy to religious interpretation can be notice begin from the moment of conception and if it be not know whether give action here abortion interfere with the protection of this life it should be assume that it be convention on the right of the child and if the polish interpretation accord to pro choice circle contaminate with catholic thinking be not enough let us reach for much wide document the convention on the right of the child this agreement be ratify by poland as early as 1991 and what be more it be poland that propose the un human rights commission to adopt it and present the draft in its provision the convention repeat the postulate of the declaration of the right of the child adopt in 1959 the child due to his physical and mental immaturity require special care and attention include appropriate legal protection both before and after birth the last fragment be important because it also grant the aforementione right to the child in the womb the convention do not clearly define when child begin again the principle of in dubio pro vita humana can be invoke the provision on legal protection before birth be sufficient condition to recognize that the body be subject to this protection from the moment of conception and not an imaginary point in time iii uncertain position of biologist the biological point of view have one fundamental flaw even pro abortionist admit that it be impossible to clearly determine at what point in development we be deal with human being therefore they resort to such abstract concept as identify humanity with consciousness with independence from the mother's organism with the feeling of pain or they simply set certain arbitrary age of the fetus beyond which we have full right to life and before it no right this type of argumentation be not only ridiculous but also ignorantly selective which will be discuss in more detail in the section devote to philosophical issue so let us leave this argument unproven for the moment let us turn off the emotion turn on the thinking and come overpro life voice religious philosophical legal biological and social argument against abortion,0

human life in it he condemn abortion as cruel crime all kind of homicide genocide abortion euthanasia and voluntary suicide all these and similar thing and practice be shameful by infect human civilization they dishonor those who commit they more than those who be harm and they be most contrary to the reverence due to the creator john paul ii also say that in the case of an inherently unjust law which be the law that allow abortion and euthanasia one must never comply with it nor participate in shape public opinion favorable to such law or show support for it by vote it be worth note that many catholic treat the teaching of the church very selectively treat they as an excuse only on very specific issue this be not what true faith be about by give the opinion of religious authority only when it fit our belief we distort the idea of religion the position of the church be and have always be clear abortion be an absolute and ruthless evil abortion in other religion what about the other six percent that be not cover by this interpretation other religion be also critical of abortion different branch of christianity orthodoxy like catholicism share the view that human life begin at conception abortion be therefore treat as murder many protestant sect mainly orthodox hold similar opinion the large protestant church in poland the evangelical augsburg church in poland in statement from 1991 strongly advocate the protection of life from the moment of conception and oppose the use of early term abortion pill church associate in the evangelical alliance be also against abortion the southern baptist convention be an outright opponent of abortion jehovah's witness be against abortion god consider life sacred he already see the embryo as separate human being king david be inspire to write about god your eye have even see my embryo psalm at one time god declare that anyone who harm an unborn child will be hold accountable thus in god's eye kill such child be murder exodus 23 buddhism although buddhism do not have an official interpretation on abortion many monastic code refer to traditional scripture recognize the moment of conception as the beginning of human life for this reason abortion as the conscious destruction of this life be treat as something wrong theravada and vajrayana monk be disfellowshippe for assist in abortion the current dalai lama also advocate negative view of abortion say that it be an act of murder so accord to the teaching it should be stigmatize it be also worth mentioningthat traditional buddhist scripture do not differ in the approach to early and late abortion each case be associate with negative moral or karmic consequence hinduism traditional hindu text condemn abortion this crime be treat depend on the source on par with break the vow of chastity mahanarajana upanishad as bad than kill one's parent kaushitaki upanishad and even equal to kill brahmin priest which in hinduism be one of the heavy crime if not the heavy woman who have an abortion risk lose her caste status the abortion itself be call bhrunahatya fetal murder and the person who perform it be call bhrunahan killer of learn brahmin in hinduism life begin at conception abortion therefore cause the death of person and this violate the principle principle of faith ahimsa the term literally mean non harm religion say firm no to abortion most major religion therefore have clear and negative stance on abortion human life begin at conception so any interference that cause the death of an embryo or fetus be reprehensible in one way or another it be worth note that in most case the murder of an unborn child be treat at least as and sometimes even as more serious crime than the murder of bear person of course as note early we absolutely should not impose the morality of our religion on other but if we profess give faith we should live accord to its guideline and those regard abortion be usually clear ii the law protect the fetus the issue of abortion be not top down regulate by eu law so it remain within the competence of the member state constitution of the republic of poland the constitution of the republic of poland of april 1997 read the republic of poland provide every person with legal protection of life article 38 and everyone be equal before the law article 32 so it remain only to define the moment when man be create the constitution do not answer this question mainly because it be general act but the constitutional tribunal do in the decision of may 28 1997 reference number 26 / 96 we read the value of the constitutionally protect legal good which be human life include life develop in the prenatal phase can not be differentiate there be no sufficiently precise and justified criterion to make such differentiation depend on the stage of development of human life from the moment of its creation human life become constitutionally protect value this also apply to the prenatal phase this position be also uphold year later judgment of january 2004 reference number 14 / 03 all possible doubt as to the protection of human life should be resolve in favor of this protection in dubio pro vita humana this mean that human life clear analogy to religious interpretation can be notice begin from the moment of conception and if it be not know whether give action here abortion interfere with the protection of this life it should be assume that it be convention on the right of the child and if the polish interpretation accord to pro choice circle contaminate with catholic thinking be not enough let us reach for much wide document the convention on the right of the child this agreement be ratify by poland as early as 1991 and what be more it be poland that propose the un human rights commission to adopt it and present the draft in its provision the convention repeat the postulate of the declaration of the right of the child adopt in 1959 the child due to his physical and mental immaturity require special care and attention include appropriate legal protection both before and after birth the last fragment be important because it also grant the aforementione right to the child in the womb the convention do not clearly define when child begin again the principle of in dubio pro vita humana can be invoke the provision on legal protection before birth be sufficient condition to recognize that the body be subject to this protection from the moment of conception and not an imaginary point in time iii uncertain position of biologist the biological point of view have one fundamental flaw even pro abortionist admit that it be impossible to clearly determine at what point in development we be deal with human being therefore they resort to such abstract concept as identify humanity with consciousness with independence from the mother's organism with the feeling of pain or they simply set certain arbitrary age of the fetus beyond which we have full right to life and before it no right this type of argumentation be not only ridiculous but also ignorantly selective which will be discuss in more detail in the section devote to philosophical issue so let us leave this argument unproven for the moment let us turn off the emotion turn on the thinking and come overpro life voice religious philosophical legal biological and social argument against abortion,0
